Sometimes my chats won't open when I click on them. Also the little chat bubbles won't appear anymore, when I have the chat open. Please sort.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This is the worst app ever. Unusable. Crashes constantly. Doesn't load most recent news feed. It takes several minutes to open a picture. My phone is so fast on everything else. Facebook: stop adding features and fix what you've already got!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook it's to slow . I can even check , my messages cuz it freezes every time , come on do something :/	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Haven't had any problems with crashing .  Would like if app was more in sync with the pages on the computer.  Would also like to have all the games available.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
When I get a message I can't reply to it I only can read the message	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Yeah it's great!!! It's better now I love it !!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
For some reason, the app constantly has a badge saying that I have 2 new notifications even though I have none. It won't go away even after restarting my device.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is horrible, the developers of this app have just let it go down hill. Facebook in general has gone down hill. It crashes way to much, I have to re open it over and over and by the time it finally lets me use it, I don't even want to use it anymore. It's not my phone. It's this horrible app. I used to love the old Facebook app, smooth and simple, now there's way too much. What makes me mad is when Facebook alerts me when people update their status, post pictures, or when it's someone's birthday. I DON'T CARE!! I can see they posted a status when I'm on my news feed! I don't need annoying notifications. That's pretty sad that this app has to send notifications just so people have a reason to click on it and use it. Because if it didn't, I wouldn't touch this app ever again. Simply horrible.Would have rated it lower but the lowest you can put is one star.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love FB, when u need to let out some thing FB is what u need....!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app is great I can now keep in contact with my friends I give it 5 stars !	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I read a few reviews and guess I don't have the same issues as often. The amount of data that is crossing the line is the issue. There's a lot of data so just remember to shut down your device once a week. Same with any computer! I love Facebook, even with the changes. I just make the time to get used to it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can't upload videos over a minute long. Can't change covers on mobile..Garbage app	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Thanks for making it better all the time	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Needs improvement .	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Bad app for a bad website. I still use it tho cause I'm a tool with no life. Update: I can no longer use this app because any time I open it, there's a connection error. You should be getting paid to download this useless pile of junk, and in addition, iTunes should allow you to rate zero stars, solely for this app. Update: app still doesn't work, I had to use a third party tweak to get it to stay open for more than 10 seconds.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I have zero problems with this app, and zero problems from update to update. It may crash every once in a while (maybe once a month) but runs smoothly and keep the updates coming!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
love it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
This app on the iPhone is sucking my will to live.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have to frequently restart my phone just to get the app to update. Happens about once a day and it is annoying.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Worked fine for months... Now it crashes every time I touch anything. WHYYYYYYYYY!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Works okay, but not awesome. Some pictures and statuses are slow to load even when connected to wifi.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
App is horrible!!  Freezes constantly and most recent is NEVER most recent. Furthermore I can't get on my laptop it claims I have the wrong password. When I write to get a reset even THAT doesn't work. NOT a fan :(	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have an iPad and i CANNOT change my cover page!!! Why?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can't believe this app passed testing. Horrible, buggy, pretty much useless	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Crashes a lot and updates do nothing to help	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app has not worked at all for me in the past 3 days. I tried re downloading it but it still won't update anything. It's been freezing on me since I downloaded it, but now it won't work at all.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
facebook app do not have video call like on the web ,it is good ‰Û_ I wish the new version can call people	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
My personal fb is ok...wish you'd stop changing stuff all the time and the hash tag is stupid. Since creating a page for my photography my opinion had gone down even further. It takes forever to get updates and I can't even see everyone who likes the page! If you are going to change something why don't you fix some of the issues!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I really like the new update except that it tells me I have notifications, but it won't let me see them, it won't update my news feed or notifications. I love the chat bubbles and all the new buttons at the bottom, and the new features in the status update. Please fix!!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Most of the time it's easier to use my iPhone when it doesn't crash or finally does open. I can add photos to my personal page albums but I can't to my other pages, not good.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Always crashes	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Very laggy, message icon does not change when message received, order of 'Most Recent' status updates is random and makes no sense. Some updates do not even show in my News Feed. This app gets worse at each update. This is an awful app Facebook. Don't you guys even test it???	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Regardless of it crashing or failing to even run, all in all it runs rather slow.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a great way to keep in touch with ur friends across the water	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It's a great app while it's working...which is about half the time. Loading takes a very long time, and it's twice as slow with pictures, where it crashes most of the time. So annoying.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Love keeping in touch with family and friends around the world :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
QUIT putting suggested apps and suggested pages in my feed. I keep hiding them and FB keeps bringing them back. Leave my wall alone!Also I am VERY tired of it crashing all the time.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
For the love of god, how many times is this app going to have a pop up screen showing me how to enable push notifications?!  It comes up repeatedly while checking recent notifications and must be dismissed every time. I DON'T WANT PUSH NOTIFICATIONS!  IF I DID, I WOULD TURN THE CRAP ON! I DON'T WANT FB CRAP TAKING OVER MY PHONE!!  STOP OFFERING ME REPEATED DIRECTION TO TURN IT ON!! IT IS ANNOYING AS SIN!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's alright, but as always there's something lacking. I really don't like the way I basically can't look at photos (enlarge and whatnot) without the caption overlay popping back over it. It makes it incredibly difficult to see bits of the photo and I frankly annoying.Also I hate the way the whole news feed jumps around while it automatically updates itself - I can't do anything while its bouncing, and have to wait for it to finish! What's the point of 'pull down to refresh' then?!Otherwise, an alright update.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
This app should have a number on the corner of the icon to notify you of notices, like how the App Store shows updates	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
All of ur fb apps keep crashing. And I would really like the option to share other pages on my own page from the pages app. Ur desk top app for the iPhone and iPad also do not work properly. Fix it please	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Great app plenty of updates keeping the look fresh	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

My app keeps crashing. Not sure why but its horrible to try to open over and over again. Also, the chat doesn't update half of the time, showing I have a message but showing old messages. Help	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It seems like there is more and more trouble for what used to be a pretty good ap. It crashes quite frequently and group functions are beyond poor. Please help us loyal followers!! (:	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great concept but if u post something they don't like they remove it. They target conservatives and unfortunately that is what has made them political. Very sad.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Every time i open the app it crashes and shuts down, takes about 5 attempts to actually open the app. Sort it out.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Can't edit a photo once it is uploaded, have to open FB via Safari. But, everything else looks great. Sometimes it's slow to load, maybe due to connection, but otherwise very happy.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
App interface is not bad, but not great.  When posting updates in current location it seems to eat a lot if bandwidth and takes forever to load listing.  Maybe shorten listing to take care if the issue?  I mean who really needs to go 15 pages to find the place they are at?  It's usually number one.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I like it ._.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
My app hasnt worked in 2 weeks. No matter how many times i click to open it, it closes before it does anything. Very annoying!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate the new version where I CONSTANTLY have to click the "Most recent" button, and many of my "liked" pages aren't loading!!!!! This is terrible!!!!!  Fix the iPhone version so the most recent will stay constantly and everything will load all the time and in order like it is supposed to	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Perfect!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
All of the sudden it started crashing. Not cool. Status update does not work. Keeps crashing.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
When I use the app it breaks down again & again. I deleted and re-installed but the problem is same. It does not stay open even 20 seconds. Help me out! Its a great app!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Slowbook or adbook are new names in the works....so slow to navigate through and too many ads.  Is this the end of Facebook?	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It doesn't let you use your lists, and it crashes often. It works, barely. There really needs to be a better app for Facebook.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Muy buena	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I actually go on Facebook all the time now with this app. It's awesome.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It take several time before I can even get on it and them shut off on it own. It has been updated an yet still having the same problem.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I updated an my app turned back to the previous lay out. I prefer the app where the tabs are to the bottom!! :(	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I think the new facebook is great :)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
This app crashed before the last update, but since the last update, I can't even get it to open!! Horrible! Whatever happened to "if its not broken, don't fix it"? It use to work well a couple of updates ago!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Having the ability to copy and paste text on the iPad app would be very helpful. I have friends who speak another language and I miss out on the ability to understand what their writing because I can't copy and paste text into a translator.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Freezes up, closes down...what else? They should take some of that IPO money and fix the program.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Crashes always and very very slow	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good app. It works and all but every time I try to post pictures it crashes and when I go to someone else wall it crashes. Before every time I would go on it it would crash but ever since the last update it works fine	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Great app on IPhone ( I use IPhone 4 ), the only problem is it sometimes takes 2-3 attempts to open the app without it shutting me out before loading. I'd have chalked I up to a phone flaw, but it's the only app I use that does it. ( I use many Internet-based apps ).	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Slow load time on 4G LTE...Worst app on my phone!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app would be better if it looked and functioned exactly like the desktop version.  Also unable to fully log out (on the ipad version) for another user to use for games.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
helps the maximum expression of the human experience ;)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Every time this app updated, it makes it worse than before.  When it functions properly, it's wonderful - but that's rare.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

5/27/13: 6/12/13: 6/24/13: still force closing, still can't copy n paste other's posts, still can't use horizontally, wrong times for when people are actually on chat and how long idle, BOGUS NOTIFIERS will say I have 5 when I only have 2!, and this review probably still won't submit!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

The app is constantly just shutting itself down when I am the middle of something. I thought it was my poor Internet connection but it turns out that a lot of my friends with the app also have this problem! It's just really bad.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Getting fed up of updates that make the app worse... This time only get a few recent status updates then loads from the day before...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Practically useless. Takes forever for anything to come up. Wish I had never downloaded the latest update	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This Facebook is TERRIBLE!!! So SLOW & nothing works right at all!!! All these updates never make it any better!!!! Needs to be fixed the right way ASAP!!!! It's so ANNOYING!!!!! Very very very DISAPPOINTED in this app!!!! 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I can't share other posts to Facebook at all. It always gives me an "upload failed" message. Or the thread I would like to share never loads.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
When I use the "Most Recent" list, posts show up to 30 minutes ago and then jump to 7 hours ago. What happened to the last 6 hours?And why can't you make "Most Recent" as the default friends feed? I knew I shouldn't have gotten this latest update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have to close the app completely with multi task for any hope of loading content with the next open. It's terribly slow to load. It used to be just fine.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I thin you should do faceboo like it is on your computer for your iphone	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

It worked fine for a day or so then it crashed and refuses to start again. So frustrating.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I use Facebook but hate the app on all accounts sorry guys but you failed miserably the app uses to many resources all any device I also have an lg optimism 9 and the app crash on that as well I may come to the point where I stop using Facebook all together. Iv lived with out it before I'm sure I can live with out it now. Also I have many friends that feel the same way and some have stopped using Facebook already	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I need to use Facebook to communicate with school and sports groups, and this app won't let me do that. To begin with, it might take six tries to open the app in the first place. And once it does open, it might not even update anything. In fact, it often shows me statuses and other things from 2-3 weeks ago, and then will not update to anything new for days, just give me other old things. And if I'm trying to message with one of my team members, the app will most often crash several times before I can get any message sent. The bubbles on the screen for messaging are a good idea, but they are very slow, and make the app crash. So all in all, if I didn't need to have Facebook on my iPod, I wouldn't.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes constantly. Always says network error and its unable to load. The chat heads are annoying too.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
As soon as i tryed to open the app when i finished downloading the new version it crased, so please, fix that. And please, show the notifications on the screen, such as if someone liked your photo, or coment on something, not only showing the red ball on the closed app. And i would appreciate if  you put the landscape mode back. Thank you.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

This update I got is super slow to load anything. I also deleted the app and re downloaded thinking app was bad. Now I can't even log in. Fix this ASAP horrible update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It constantly crashes, really slow, and is buggy!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app rarely loads completely, sometimes not at all, since the most recent update. Pictures are often blank, messages unanswerable, etc. I can count on it to work properly maybe 1 out of 10 tries. Maybe.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Deleted and reinstalled yet again as it crashed when commenting. Better just using on PC/Mac or what ever floats your boat. Getting tired of app constantly needing updates. Get it working and leave it alone, please????	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

How ever is the person in charge of this crop should be either fire or transfer to another job. Seriously you presented a really disappointed product here.

Too many problems to name!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I use i the most on my iphone. but I don't know why  it crashes multiple times a day. Any suggestions?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Think what's missing from this app after the update is the direction it's heading in... Turn the map around go back to the last setting and start the journey again cos this update is s@&? !!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I check Facebook every day, and I have very few issues with its functionality, except when it comes to videos. If I watch a video within my feed, it usually crashes halfway through. Recently I tried watching a six-minute video and it crashed three times. Following a link that leads to a video also leads to problems. The video sometimes crashes, or it simply refuses to load. This all means that I have begun to associate videos on Facebook with my PC laptop, and that my iPad is just for skimming (i.e. not fully functional).	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It works perfectly! People who have problems have problems with their phone or whatever.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app has been running extremely slow on my phone for forever! I end up waiting until I'm at my laptop to do anything.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
What's point in up dating this app when it doesn't work in the first place work on the bugs then make it better, would be good if you can unfollow a status with the app after you've comment fed up of reading everyone else's comments so much so I hardly comment on statuses now which kinda defeats the object of Facebook in my opinion ...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Can you fix that on the mobile app you can't get your feelings but on the laptop you can?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

I'm an avid user of Facebook along with my 1,000's of friends!  Hands down, there's no substitute for this social media and marketing tool!

This app is garbage. You updated it, but it didn't do much, work on the most important, people's opinions and fix it, now.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashed during update. Now it won't finish update and I can't get into FB. You guys are terrible at mobile FB!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Version 6.2 is a bust. Doesn't work at all on my iPhone 5!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
You would think that Facebook of all people could make an app that actually works, gets it sorted!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
There is a guaranteed crash when I open this app and after that happens it take me extra time to switch to 'all friends' mode. It take a total of like 5 minutes just to start scrolling until it crashes again. If I could rate 0 stars I would in a heartbeat.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever wonder why people get angry at you for not replying to messages?! When the app is not even open, it shows you as online and right there to chat. People think you're reading their messages and just ignoring them. This app will truly make you look a mug. Worth deleting Facebook as a website. Disgusting morons.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Do you not use this app yourselves, developers?  I hate doing your beta testing!!  Where are the friend lists and why did you make the share link not able to add text before posting?  Why can I still not delete a post made on someone else's wall?  Not liking it!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The only complaint I have about this app is that it crashes every twenty seconds. It is great for checking my Facebook on the go.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Hate all the changes. With every update/improvements, this app gets slower and slower. The programmers really need to listen to the specific complaints and do something about it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ever since the 3 latest updates Facebook has been closing down on me once in a while, and cancels everything I was doing. I thought I was the only one, but a few of my friends with the iPhone have been having the same problems. Please fix them!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Now I have to go into 'more' in order to access my profile... Not user friendly, bring older style back! Don't like icons at bottom either, last 1 was fine leave it ** sigh!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Updated the app this morning and now complete and utter rubbish. Constant problems. Come on and get it sorted. Very unhappy customer :-(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This app is amazing. You get to keep up to date with other people and its a way to chat to people you don't have the chance to. I know it may have some faults but overall i think this app is excellent	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
What happened to my chat bubbles? Now I can't even open my messages...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

weak sauce....please fix...used to work fine...now crash,crash,crash	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seriously, if this app crashes ONE MORE TIME I will delete it and just use Safari on my iPhone.  I was planning on yesterday's update to fix the crashing issues and it only made it worse.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time i open it it crashes probably 3 times then works but recently i had to delete the app and redownload it this is my weekly ritual fix it !!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This is getting ridiculous. Every update just makes it worse.'Most recent' means the last things that have happened, not things that happened several hours ago, THEN the most recent.Still rarely get friends news in my news feed and I've checked all the settings.So disappointing. I'd rather just log onto Facebook via explorer than use this app.Please test your updates properly.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Too much lag . At some point I can't even click on picture because its lagging too much . Sometime I can wait 20 sec before the image finally pop out . Fix it please , awefull.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

It keeps crashing. Ever since i downloaded the new update, every time I open it, BOOM! It crashes. Can you fix it soon?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
This app is frozen during the installation of the update. I don't think I can do anything about it, either. I should've read the other reviews before updating this.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Remember when the Facebook App actually worked ???? Who are these jokers saying great and fab??? Either blind and stupid or employees of Facebook. We all know it does not work but they can't be bothered to fix it. Time maybe we all drop the old FB!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Update this morning and can no longer log on, keeps timing out. So have deleted it. Pants! You have been warned!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Liked the app the way it was before with the navigation on the left side, and notifications on the top. With the navigation on the bottom, it takes up screen space and is very noticeable especially after using the previous version of the app. Other than that its an excellent app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Takes forever to load (no its not my wifi) always randomly closes on me. They took away the blue links and replace them with black bold letters which I don't see the point in. I can't figure out how to delete comments or tag people in pictures before you post them- you have to upload the picture then tag in the comment. The app before this one was a much much better version.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I found the app's News Feed is missing several posts when I compare it to the web page.  Makes me worry I've missed stuff over time.  Will not be using the app for the time being.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still lacks the option to choose pictures from my photo stream albums...  App crashes.Posts order doesn't stick, i want to order as most recent, but it never stays that way!!!Plz fix that	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

...and you hire developers straight outta high school. What is wrong with you people? I stopped "downgrading" at 5.2. If you "downgraded" to 6.2 and want to go back delete it and go sync. Provided you haven't synced since you "downgraded" you should get your old version back.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

For the last two weeks my Facebook service has been appalling. It drops out and closes when ever I am in the middle of a chat. I cannot access the pages I like to visit properly - I cannot see other members' comments and I cannot comment myself even if I open the link to those particular Facebook pages in my browser. It has become a truly asocial social network. I updated this morning in the hope that would improve things, but alas no. The fixes have not fixed anything. Please resolve this Facebook - and stop filling my feed with irritating suggestions about games I may like to play or commercial behemoths I would like to 'like'. If I liked them I would shop there. I do not wish my newsfeed to be littered with their incessant marketing. I come on Facebook to relax and share information with friends - not to be browbeaten into liking your commercial sponsors/ shareholders. Very poor service just now.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Not liking the new Facebook update for the iPhone. It puts the notifications and everything at the bottom of the screen. Too easy to hit the buttons and change out of what I was reading.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I try and open the app and I have to open it a few times for it to actually open and then I try and look at pictures on profiles and it crashes the app and when I try to upload pictures it does the same thing, it crashes. These problems need to me fixed, I usually don't right reviews but this needs to be fixed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
To whomever is responsible for this app, you should be sad and embarrassed as I am sure their friends and family are the most embarrassed as they should for being friends or related to the biggest failure in the history of app developers. How you have ever been gainfully employed is amazing as you should definitely be on disability since you are obviously handicapped and if you have been denied your right to disability benefits all you need to do is show them this app as it definitely will be the proof you need to qualify for a claim. I'll be waiting for a sleazy law firm to file a class action lawsuit against you so I can be compensated for all my time lost that clearly you are responsible for. Good luck in your future endeavors at sucking at life, sincerely the guy trying to help you get the help you need	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Please fix soon	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I was keeping my fingers crossed that the next update would reform the Facebook app into a speedy worthwhile app. No, I was wrong. Another waste of space. Same problems, just even worse. Do Facebook not test these updates before release?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

It's better than its been for a while, but it's still frustrating. The app should realise I have fb messenger installed and not notify me about chat messages! Or at least the chat notification should go away if I open it in messenger...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
The update force quits about half of the time I use the app. Mostly when I'm trying to message someone.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Congratulations on this almost version of the Facebook app. To put it another way ewwwww ewwwww ewwww. What happened?? The iStore said "update"...this comes across more out of date. There seem to be massive format errors with overlaps between posts in the news feed, bits go missing and then come back, we've regressed back to having a menu bar at the left and chat at the right (just after REALLY getting used to the most recent layout)...the bad list goes on. I'm a Facebook fan...get me out of here!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Apart from the embarrassing ongoing notification sounds problem still, the ads are very annoying and newsfeed seems to put things in whatever order it wants, no matter which view you're in?? Why's it so difficult to display things in date/time order?Just seems that existing problems aren't being fixed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
How can they get every single update so spectacularly wrong. Terrible for an official app, and unforgivable with all the money they have. Barely stable and nothing works or displays properly.  Crashes on startup 95% of the time. Numpties. Utter 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Seriously? What's the deal? It crashes all the time when I try to open it and it won't even let me refresh my newsfeed. Isn't facebook suppose to one of the most versatile apps?

I am extremely disappointed in the newest version of this app. I am constantly being kicked off in the middle of writing a message or just scrolling through my news feed. I can't seem to get anything done because I'm repeatedly kicked off at random times. Like I said, I am very disappointed and displeased.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app works perfectly fine on my iphone5	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The update is horrible. The app crashes constantly, doesn't load, is super-slow, and you still can't type in landscape mode. Each update seems to make the app worse instead of better! This is about the 10th time I've had to re-download this app since the most recent update because it keeps crashing and then it gets to the point where it won't even open until you delete it and download again.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This app is pure junk. It lags, it freezes, & it crashes like a mother****er. On more than one occasion, it has refused to open at all, forcing me to uninstall the app, restart my phone, reinstall it, & sit around waiting for it to happen again. I do not recommend this. Just use safari to access Facebook (~_~')	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app to have! I can connect with friends and family anytime, anywhere!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The layout of the new Facebook app is unpleasant to the customer! Most customers have been giving this new Facebook one star; it's mostly because it looks terrible! Sure it's more practical, straightforward if you say so; yet it would be better if you renovated it! Renovate it to be easier to use than the previous version, yet make it appealing to the eye (of course)! Still don't stray towards any other color (black!) stick to the Facebook colors you've chosen!        You all fail as a developer! You strive to make the app faster yet you add useless features (like the ugly black bar at the bottom) and slow it down again! You blatantly ignore looks and usefulness! How can you do such a stupid thing and put your app in jeopardy like that! I mean have you looked at your reviews lately!?        You should now try to make your app at least moderately appealing and intriguing! I expected more from a company in fact any company should do better than that! I am incredibly disappointed by your performance you have become bland and you sincerely remind me of a failing company!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I don't like that my newsfeed gets clogged up with my friends' likes and comments on other people's pictures or status updates. The only option I have on my phone is to not show in newsfeed. Getting tired of not seeing actual status updates!Can't post on business pages! Why the changes?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The latest update is now prone to hanging. The app only wishes to work at home. Terribly buggy and awkward.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

This app fails to load on first, second, and sometimes, third attempt. Being forced to look at 'Suggested Pages' and ads that can only be gotten rid of by reporting them as spam makes using the iPhone version a frustrating and exhausting mess, that I tend now to avoid, rather than accept. It's crap.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the last update, Facebook has been horrible!!  It will crash randomly. Statuses and photos won't load, the same with comments. I hope they get this fixed!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am not very impressed since I downloaded the update my Facebook won't load at all I have tried deleting and re downloading the app	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I Just got the iPhone5 Right before this last update and it worked fine. Since this last update all it does is crash I uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice and it still crashes. This is absolutely horrible app. The updates make it worse instead of better.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app doesn't work with the new update!!! Nothing will load on 5 different wifi networks.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I would rate this 1000 stars (:	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
BUT REALLY. It is the most frustrating thing how this app is CONSTANTLY CRASHING. Get it together Facebook my god.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With the addition of the last several updates, it seems to only get worse with crashing constantly or freezing up only to, again, crash! Also, I like to keep my newsfeed on most recent but constantly have to reset that as well! I check FB daily so I don't need to see what I already read the day before!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
My sound is on for this app and for the past five thousand updates there are no sound for when I receive a notification. It also keeps saying I have some when I don't. Stupid app	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
From the other reviews, looks like lots of people are having problems with the app crashing.  I'm not having any problems-/ works fine, nice app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Occasional bumps in the road are expected, especially with a technology so rapidly changing as Facebook, but come on guys, you can do better than this...With the current version of the App, I am patently unable to see certain posts or comments that I can clearly see exist when I check in Mobile or from the web. The case that spawned this review is such that I could see a notification that multiple comments were waiting for me, but I couldn't see them. Worse, I could infer from surrounding comments that they carried information important to me.It wouldn't be so bad if the problem improved when I attenpted to update the post, or when I shut down the App and restarted it, or restarted my phone and tried it all again, but the problem persists now, an hour later.So what makes this bad enough to warrant a 1-star rating? In simplest terms, for a communications app to make communications *more difficult* is unacceptable. This bug is directly preventing me from effectively being able to carry on conversations (much less the business they carry).	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With the amount of times I'm asked to update this app it's not worth it. Stop adding new features and fix the app itself. Crashes often. Extremely slow load time. When I try to see my most recent feed I expect to see the most recent things not yesterday's stuff even after updating the feed multiple times.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Slow to connect and keeps cutting off!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
This app has good sides, and Facebook is nice to use here. I like the chatting idea. The browsing is good. But it lacks many things that are needed in an app. We should be able to crop out our profile picture by this app, it doesn't let us crop at all! And it crashes so many times! Ohh! This is so annoying! Crash, crash, crash! That's so aggravating! Fix that!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
It's a ok app no problems at times,but crashes a lot	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The snails pace and crash-proneness of this app reminds me of the Internet access I used to deal with while traveling abroad in 2004.  Seriously slow and seriously frustrating...but you put up with it because you kinda have to.  I am about to chuck the app altogether some days and just use my browser.Also, I do agree, it would be nice if the app had the same functionality as the full site.  Like why can't I share a post to my Facebook page like I can online? These little things frustrate me to no end...like enough that I actually wrote this review!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Yeah it crashes a lot but whatever happened to "landscape mode!" That was the best part and then it went away. Please bring that back before you do anything else. Of course you don't care cause we'll just have to deal with it right? Whatever.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like a lot of features but I feel like you should be able toDelete more than one photo at a time in the albums. I know you can delete the whole photo album but I'mNot sure if you can delete more than one photo in it at the time. (On the app or on an actual computer).	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Used to very much like FB, but updates mean I can't see or post on sites like QVC and more on iPhone and iPad its VERY ANNOYING! I've complained so many times and I'm not the only one! Get it sorted please, and those dam flashing adds stating I've one a iPhone /pad etc or my PCM has a virus or mail, PLEASE STOP THIS CRAP!! Totally fed up with it all! FB used to be fun, not any more!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It's a good app but sometimes it takes a lot of time to load my notifications & it closes the app by its self -.- please fix that thanks	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
My only issue (iPhone 5 user) is that Facebook seems to have problems loading the most recent posts sometimes. Other than that, it runs smooth.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I like like the Facebook app but I am giving it a 1 star because it messed up the chat. I mean I can still chat good but still... It is not that great. I can get on people's wall and mine great but it messed up the chat. So if you do Facebook chat do not upgrade Facebook. They could have done better  then that... I like the one before the upgrade and I hate it showing the news all the time.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Between trying Facebook for iPad a few months ago, and now, many significant improvements have been made and now, I almost prefer it to accessing through Safari.  Some things could still be improved, like a delete spam button and being able to navigate away from the app while chatting and know if whomever you are chatting with has replied.  Also, quite irksome is not being able to play some videos within the app.  I imagine they'll get there, eventually.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

not sure how long the "New Stories" button has been part of this app but its completely unnecessary and just gets in the way. really don't know why this was implemented in a constantly changing stream that is, by definition, always "new".let's get rid of that in the next release shall we?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This is the worst app on my phone. It freezes constantly, the app shuts down and closes unexpectedly. I am writing this now because it has been frozen on the same news feed story for 4 hrs and that happens all the time. Photos also freeze frequently.....What a joke, such a big name company can't create an app that performs its basic functions properly?! I've been losing interest in FB for a while...this might seal the deal.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps crashing and freezing. I hate the pop up chat that you have to drag to the x at the bottom. If I want to look at private or chat messages I'll go to them when I'm ready, not have to move them cos they're in the way and annoying	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	New Zealand

I don't check as often now. I genuinely like fb but this new update for apple I wish I never had done! It's poor and not user friendly! No profile option! What is that all about? Icons at the bottom? Why I could just slide to the left before that was much better. For crying out loud I just like to look at status's and my profile and it just seems harder and harder every update. Come on please just simplify like it used to be! This update is CRAP!!!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It crashes too often. I have trouble loading anything beyond the basic newsfeed. It usually crashes if I try and open anything besides the newsfeed. The Search ability is incredibly slow even on high-speed wifi. I only use this app for the sake of convenience as opposed to using a web browser. I hope they come out with an update soon that can fix the issues I have mentioned:1.) Crashing on everything aside from Newsfeed 2.) Slow search capabilitiesIf these were to be fixed soon I will continue to use it and suggest it to others. As it stands now, I will probably soon delete the app and go with a web browser, and I would offer up the suggestion to avoid this app. The app looses ints convenience as soon as you open it. I really would like to see improvements made on this app and soon.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If you want your personal info sold to corporations and given freely to the government, and if you want an app with progressively less features and more junk (read: ads) then this app is for you!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am constantly on facebook. You can ask my husband. My problem with the app is that it is entirely too slow to load, i always have to tap "most recent" and even then I see posts from the day before! I still hate that I can't turn my phone sideways and type on the keyboard horizontally! This app could be SO much better!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I finally got it to function, but not well. It keeps closing for no reason, and it won't stay locked in the landscape position. I am now SO sorry I updated this app! It worked fine before.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
You guys are a billion dollar corporation, pretty sure you can pay someone to fix these bugs. Cant even use the app longer than a minute. Sick of clicking anything and then it crashes.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
FB is great for the social media side of things. The one complaint that I have is that you can't do certain things on an iPad and you have to do them from a laptop or desktop.Outside of that, as long as they don't keep changing things on it all the time, I think it's a great tool to use for both personal and business side of life.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

The most annoying app ever!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
App must be fully Accessable in any and all text fields and menu navigation!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This is a Terrible update. I'm tired of the app freezing and giving me problems. FIX IT!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest upgrade has been nothing but a headache. Constantly crashing. I am always needing to restart the app because it freezes every time I try and view pics. Fix it!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Fab app	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Not liking the new up-date - notifications at the bottom?! Why O why FB !?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
What can I say? We're all addicted, whether you like it or not:))	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I think Facebook was great with the messages  and the post and likes and comments but now it's getting boring and people always talk smack about other people and starts problems .so Facebook was great but not so great anymore now that there's Instagram kik and keek .	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Restore landscape view than ask me to review; as is my rating is low. Still lots of bugs and it freezes! Grr hate it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The most recent is not posting the most recent status updates on the iPhone. Please fix!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every since the last update that you all made, The Facebook app is entirely too slow now Loading. And after I have Squirrel about three pages and on Facebook crashes then I have to go back on Facebook then it will crash again it will do this about three times before letting me back on. But it is extremely slow when the app is Running. And also two, the accessibility will not read pictures to me so therefore I cannot share them with my friends, because I will not share a picture that I don't know what it says. So if you can make it 100% accessibility For all post statuses and pictures I would appreciate that please. And on accessibility when I go to a page to push like on it, it won't let me push like or share all it says is more when I click on it it tells me to share the page I'm not wanting to share the page when I first liking it it won't give me The option to push like on it. So if you can please fix these problems I will gladly rate Facebook five stars thank you	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It is really awesome !	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This just simply doesn't work... Used to work in older version... Crashes, won't load, takes forever, have to keep closing it and opening it, have to delete it and re download it... This is garbage.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm constantly deleting and re-downloading the app because it gets to the point were it keeps updating the feed by itself and then everything doubles.. Then I can See any Pictures or like any post and even comment... uuuugghhhhh....	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It freezes all the time doesn't matter what your on. ( Computer or iPhone) then when it does come up it crashes. I'm very disappointed with this app now because it used to be a good app. But  you have people putting up gross, rude, and stupid pictures and much more...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This recent update you've done to Facebook has slowed the app down so much!! It wasn't the quickest beforehand but was ok for a phone. But since I've downloaded the latest, it takes close to 20 minutes to load the news feed when I open up my app and still pings me with notifications but cannot get to see them as it takes forever to load!! Very, very disappointed in this latest version. Sort it out, QUICK!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Ever since I updated this app, it keeps crashing and its hella slow. Fix it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
FB is a great way to keep in contact with friends & family, especially those who don't live locally! Also, a good way to locate someone you have lost contact with over the years! Stay in the loop & up to date with community events & things going on around you. It is a convenient & safe way to get rid of/sell things your not wanting anymore &/or find good bargains on thins your wanting/needing! Just a little warning tho....it can get very addicting! Haha, but that's a good thing for FB!;) *****	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love fb and chat, but in the fb app the chat won't load the new messages. It's a huge pain.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
What happened to keeping in touch with friends?  Now it seems to be all about Ads. Not liking the new Facebook	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

1). Why can't the cover photo in the app maintain the same size/resolution as it appears on the browser/desktop version? Cover Photos get cut off at the sides with this app, and given how much money Facebook INC. has, you'd think this menial detail would be attended to.2). Why can't we customize our audiences more specifically, and more easily, in the app? I have to set my audience parameters in the browser version if needed...which makes me wonder why I bother using the app at all?3). Why can't we edit comments in the app?4). App is also very slow when looking at images. It takes forever to load an image after you tap it, and then when the image finally opens, it closes back again. Lame.5). Also.....why are posts so out of order? My settings are set to show posts in "Most Recent" order, yet I get 12 posts from last night before I see a post made 5 minutes ago. The browser version is fine, what's the issue with the app?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The app is getting better. I like Facebook over all so I like the app. It is only a few things I can't do on the app that I can do on the web.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Everytime I inbox somebody it only shows me half of what they say back and it closes out of it. It won't show pictures that I get sent and it always freezes. Do better.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Most recent newsfeed is always out of order	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Only problem I have now or I see is why when wanting to write an status it doesn't show the iPhones keyboard anymore? It shows now pics instead of the keyboard, thought that's why theirs a photo update button & a status update for writing not another photo update thing.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I use this daily with little to no problems. So much better and faster than using a browser. My only problem I have with it is that it occasionally crashes and will need to be reopened. I definitely recommend this to the average Facebook addict.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I send messages through this app and the message is seen late. This has become a problem. Plz update	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Crashes a lot. You keep making changes and don't know when to leave well enough alone!  Keep it simple!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's unpredictable, have to delete and reload. Constantly changed just for change sake. Don't see people I want no matter how many times I fix my settings. Awful. Huge inconsistency between phone, Ipad, web version of News Feed. Most recent is never actually most recent. Worst app ever. If it wasn't Facebook no one would use the app. I don't use the iPad version, I use Safari, but too small on my phone so I'm forced to use it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Awesome	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Crashes several times a day especially if in messages. Installed messenger to get around it but crashes still frequent. Insanely annoying.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

This version keeps going "No stories to show" when I go from a friend's wall back to my Newsfeed. The Newsfeed loads, but the delay is irksome for a busy person like me who can only spare a few minutes at a time.

I am generally pro-Facebook. But why can't the Messages app features be included into the Facebook app? I'll be in Facebook and tap on the iOS notification and it will switch apps to Messages. Talk about redundant. If you remove Messages, there is an ad that appears encouraging you to try it.Chat Heads have me considering removing the App all together and reverting back to using the website. I have an iPhone 4S and these things take up a substantial amount of room. Not to mention are distracting and silly. Is elegance out of the question? At least let me toggle the childish gimmick off, PLEASE.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I have to admit, the app keeps getting better. It still has issues, but let's be honest, a lot of us use it more than any other app; that counts for something.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is very useful. The only thing that that I think would better it is to make it where i could turn my screen sideways. Other than that, I love this app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
We spoke, they listened...kinda. Improved audience editing, faster messaging capabilities but there's no vine/snapchat style video clip option...you're falling behind FB. Still freezes, slow and takes a while to update after you've deleted stuff. ---------------------------------------------Letter Grade: C, Decent Effort	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
This ap is horrible! I don't understand why I don't have any problems with the functionality of my FB app on my iPhone 5 but it crashes repeatedly or just fails to update on my iPad???

So I never write reviews. But the Facebook app updates are so so so absolutely pathetic and horrible that I could not stay quiet about it anymore. It doesn't open. It doesn't update. It's basically might as well not be there. This new update was supposed to fix the fact that it crashed frequently. Well they sure as hell fixed it! How can something that doesn't even open, crash at all?! I am disappointed beyond words that a publicly traded company puts out products worse that a 3 year olds science projects. Fix it ASAP, or consider one user less on your Facebook app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Great layout and interface. Very easy to access different pages with only a swipe of your finger. However my iPod Touch 4th Generation struggles to process the data required for this app. So much that it crashes when I'm browsing and when I load it up. It has it's good and bad days. But overall it's a good app and the new bubble head chat feature is amazing!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

It works (most of the time), as a customer I do not need new features daily or even monthly, I just want it to work, with less spam in the news feed.

This app just gets worse with every update. It now takes an age to open any pictures and even crashes sometimes. Choosing between different timelines is a pain and results in me completely missing half the day at times.

Facebook is the second best thing to be invented love it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
issues with horizontal/vertical viewing.New sharing screen is slow-even scrolling is sluggish.Update: buttons keep changing for sharing a post. Won't hold settings of who can see your posts. Have to change from computer for custom setting if you change settings for a specific post.Second update: can't handle saving scrolling settings. Defaults to highlights or whatever. If you change to most recent, and you comment or share, it defaults back and you have to reset EVERY SINGLE TIME. Hardly worth using to read wall.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Unlike every other version that loaded quickly and basically functions, this version just loads constantly with no conclusion.  I have deleted and reloaded, same problem.   Certainly considering the need for the app on the phone.  If that's the case, it's only one step to disinterest in Facebook altogether.Do better.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
facebook itselft is great i like it but i cant get on the app because it crashes before it loads anything :/ wish this would get fixed!! its been like this every single update!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
No complaints, love the app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The page options on the iPhone for fb are much much more user friendly !!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Really easy to use. Very distracting. Crashes sometimes.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	New Zealand
I like Facebook games and being able to play on my phone but some games you can't play on the phone. Also sometimes it is confusing. But all and all I give it 4 stars.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Could this app take any longer to update between pages??? Jeeeez! -_-	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Awesome app LIKe	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app is horrible. It's funny how it crashes every 30 seconds wow.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still slot of bugs to be worked out	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It crashes, all the time. Every time I try to view a picture or read more of a story it crashes. Update soon with fixes.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I agree they keep updating to often and lately if had been very very very slow to up date the news feed and always closing!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
The FB app is my primary method of interacting with FB. The iPad version has an annoying bug that jumps you back pages when you share. It doesn't do this on iPhone / iPod Touch. Notifications should stay highlighted until I read them. I wish the app had some of the features available on Fera, but I'd guess FB considers them 'illegal'.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Loads quick, but that could be the 4G LTE, not necessarily the app. I don't like that you can't fully edit a post or picture like you can on the web version. Wish I could load most recent always on my news feed. Also most recent doesn't always display in chronological order. But functional, overall. I think I was just used to the version I had on my iPod touch and then had to switch to this one.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
App works pretty well prone to freezing and crashing.! But all round a nice enough experience	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

I have a iPhone 4S and latterly my Facebook app is just closing after I've been in it for 30 seconds. I have asked around and a lot of other people's is doing it too. FIX IT. And take those stupid bubbles away, worse thing ever.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It drives me crazy how slow this app goes and that it crashes at least 3 times a day. If Facebook wants to keep on top as being a number 1 place to go for social media they need to get on the ball on improving their APPS. Maybe dump the idea of having a Facebook Phone and improve the thing people actually use, THE APP!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This crashes about 5-6 TIMES before it actually opens up it is one of the worst apps EVER ! If I can rate this half a star I would !!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook people - what is going ON?? I am starting to dread seeing an update for this app as you never seem to be able to actually fix the same bugs I've had for months.It takes ages to update and refresh my home page - new stories are chronologically out of time even though they are meant to be sorted by Most Recent - I get an email notification to say that someone has commented on something and then maybe about an hour later I get the notification show up on Facebook itself.What is going ON?  We appear to be going backwards with the reliability and usability of this app.I'm considering deactivating my account.   It shouldn't be this frustrating just trying to stay in touch.  Should it?!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I love Facebook	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Nuff said.  Add a landscape orientation update.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Works great on my iphone 4s	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I think it could be a lot better of an app. So many people are always on it. The circle faces on the side after an email are annoying.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Honest opinion? It is not up to even up to a horrible standard. It freezes, crashes, and worst of all at times will not advance chat. The one thing that I do like and the only reason you got 2 star is the large smileys that can be used in chat. My family loves those as well.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
All of the designs where nice, the new one is horrible..	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
For being the number 1 social media site in the world you'd think they'd be able to make a decent app. Nope it's horrible.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes sometimes but I gives no f*ck!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Yea... it's not bad	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Ever since adding the 'chat heads' the app crashes often whenever using the message function. From receiving pictures to just typing a message. Since adding the chat heads receiving messages has also been very laggy and can take up to 5mins to load some simple text and sometimes pictures won't even come through at all.With those issues resolved its a 5 star app. With the issues it's lucky to r a 3 star app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Either crashes right after launching or does not load content at all. Do us a favor and issue an update already. App is semi-useless as is.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love fb can't function without it... Like browsing and playing games on there .. :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

Often I have to kill the app and restart it before I can check in some where.  Many things can not be edited from the app. Other than that I enjoy it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's aight	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It crashes every time I try and look at pictures	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The new update Has ruined this app. I used to be able to go when you change pictures on my Facebook page but not anymore. I have a main page for my personal use and a secondary page for my business use and I can no longer view or edit any of the photos of my business page. This app went from a four star for me down to one because it stop doing what I needed to do.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It's a good app in general, but when I have conversations with certain people the messages take a long time to load but then with others, it is fine? That really needs sorting! Also, the app crashes on a regular basis which is extremely irritating as it often happens as I am writing a message to my friend, whose conversation has just taken ages to load! Not too happy at the moment, Mark Zuckerberg!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

When I upload a new profile picture it asks me to crop the original picture and make-do with the cropped version which loses the wholesome feeling of a photo. Like misses the logo on a tshirt or a ship on the far right. It'd very nice of you if you could try and make it possible to keep the original picture but with a reposition option as in desktop Facebook. Thanks. Besides it's improved a lot!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

Please fix this app. It's slow and irritating -_____-	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The newsfeed bug (or is that feature) is about worthless. Ever since version 6, the news feed usability has been severely hampered. One cannot set the feed to most recent and have it be the default. (We used to be able to.). The newsfeed now is not updating like it should. It seems the app is getting worse, not better. I would rare it at zero stars if possible.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The good - it's Facebook on your phone.The bad - everything else.Crashes constantlyPainfully slow loading timesAwful updating of the news feed with hours missingThe app appears to have been written by a 3 year old. Pathetic.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Get rid of 'sponsored' links, apps and the "like" pages from my news feed - I don't want ads. There shld be an opt out options, like the "Do not call" list. I NEVER buy anything on FB, I don't play games, I don't like pages. I just want the friends only news feed and in order of latest news not s'thing a friend posted 5 days ago at the top before later news. New feed us USELESS!!It crashes in the middle of loading. What a joke, after all these years of complaints about the app and nothing has improved, it just keeps getting worse.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Love the app. Easy to maintain, and keep & touch with my friends. Althoee, I hope you're able to change timeline covers by now with iPads & delete albums as we wish & fix the crashing problem... Therefore, a great app. =)) By the way, (Written on another day) It seems that I can't like anything in my newsfeed. I mean like, everytime I like it, it seems to dislike back on its own. Does that mean that I liked too much news or something? FIX IT, IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE. thank you. 	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Why oh why does the app continually reset to "newsfeed" when I set it to "most recent"?  Takes too much of my time to see stories multiple times.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I love the fact I can keep upto date with Facebook world but the status' aren't always as recent as they should be and it's never in order, even though I have recent status selected. Also crashes a lot when I'm looking at things. Just have to be patient.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Every time I share a picture or create a status it shows on my news feed but when others check my profile, they can't see anything I posted.

Constantly crashing. Tried viewing photos and it crashes. Half way through typing a message and it crashes. Have to reopen the app 3 times before actually getting to use the app so that it can crash 5 mins later. One of the worst apps you can use.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebooks constant need to gather data drains my battery when I'm not even using the phone. I'm severely disappointed and the only way to fix the problem is close Facebook every time. The problem with that is that the Facebook app is very slow to open.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love using this app, layout is easy to navigate, notifications are good.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

It's relatively glitchy and extremely slow when it decides to work, but when it isn't 'cooperating', it's basically bringing up a black screen, then crashing a few seconds later. Please fix it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I'm very dissatisfied with the current version of Facebook, it Glitches, it freezes, and it force quits itself almost every time I try to use it. I know it's not the phone, it's something with the app and I can't believe it's been this long and they still haven't fixed it. It's getting ridiculous, but I don't have any other options use Facebook from my phone. So basically I'm stuck with a terrible version of an app that I'm sure could easily be fixed.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The Facebook app seriously gets worse with every update. Takes forever to open, takes a long time to fully load, and if you want to search for a page or look at pictures you may as well pull up a chair and get comfortable.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It's like a time bomb that I have to rush to look and write.  I don't want to rush every two seconds.  It has gotten so bad, I have to write messages in my Notes App just so Facebook doesn't lose what I have written.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Overall the features of the app are well done.  I have a few cons though...1.  Photo uploads...would like the ability to upload to established albums or create photo albums to upload to.  Function not there yet.2.  Changing settings for account cant be done thru the app.  You have to browse using safari to get to this functionality.  Would think at the very least the settings could be edited thru Pages Manager but you cant.3.  Changing the cover photo via app not an option.4.  Creating an event with the app...event can be created but the invite list population is very difficult as you cant see your entire list of friends without typing in the names one at a time.  Cumbersome when throwing a "large party".	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Peoples comments aren't being displayed in order, comments replying to someone else's comments often appears in front.

Facebook is a great app that keeps you in touch with friends. The only tweak I would suggest is to add an 'unlike' button on statuses, pics and videos.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Nothing loads ! Really really slow as well !	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I love the app!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It keeps crashing and making me reopening	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever since update, this app has been horrible! Doesn't update, crashes very often, very slow and stalls out! Needs to be fixed ASAP!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Awesome	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Yeah it's alright	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Egypt first.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I Like The App Very Mych Doesnt Crash At All With Me But A Few Concerns.... Why Is It That You Can So Ceartin Things On The Facebook Desktop But Cant Do It On The Mobike App. For Instance To Look At Videos You Have To Scroll Through The Persons Whole Timeline. Also On The Desktop You Can Personalize Who You Want To See You On Chat.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love the statues icons ,,, but can't edit caption on picture or crop the profile pic like before	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Why did you update it so drastically? It's not user friendly at all. Bubble heads were annoying enough and now you have to push a million icons just to get anywhere.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
It's ok. Constantly having to reopen the app is frustrating from time to time	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Chat heads are the worst "improvement" ever made to this app. I hope they fail to make it into the next incarnation. Also, Most Recent doesn't work.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Has improved after update!! Much better 	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I've been getting a lot of crashes in the app and its noticeable. Could be a bug. Gets slow at loading certain things. But other than that great.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
The only thing I don't understand is that you can as much on here as you would on a computer BUT you can't delete pictures and albums on the app... What if you haven't got a computer and this app is all you got?! Sort it out... For the app to have 5 stars you've gotta let us arrange our albums and photos are selves and be able to delete them whenever...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
ok	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Good	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Always a must have app on your phone, Happy with this apart from the occasional freeze when looking at photo's.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Cannot keep off. Share everything I can.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I don't know if the pages app is integrated but when in my FB app I choose to search for my page, I come up with the pages and not able to see my page as others do, this means I can't share pictures from it to my profile	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
The app. consistently crashes rendering impossible to even get on. Adding your own friends without being blocked is a hassle I remember now why I had deactivated my account because obviously you can't erase your own information from this site	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Make an update asapthe new version crashes ALOT	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
All I want to look at is status updates only and not shared updates or photos. Also I want to see then in time order please	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Cannot edit pics like before, it crashes and it's slow!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Bring back the old app version	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update is alright. I rate this app 5/10 because it keeps crashing	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	New Zealand
Best site	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Two thumbs up!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Best app ever!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love Facebook. I'm always on it and it never crashes. Works wherever I go and I am incredibly pleased with it! :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
After the past 2 updates, I have had to reinstall Facebook as it wouldn't reload.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Great app!! good using...but theres a little problome.... but exelent app ;)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This     Is       Spartaaaaaaaaaaaa	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good app but since update it keeps freezing and crashing. Please update	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Overall a great app! Just wish it was more like the desktop version.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I get excited when I get an update hoping its going to fix the problems. But no it just changes everything around but the problem is still there grrrrr.. Please fix it and stop it cutting out	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Works almost fine, just sometimes cannot manage well..	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

It's awesome	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Very good GUI in my opinion, only draw back is that in crashes frequently on opening...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I use it everyday to get in touch with family and friends..	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app but always could use improvements!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes all the time Worst version ever U have to reopen it every 5 mins It Suddenly shuts down while doing stuff	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever time I try to upload a video it fails. Hope they fix this soon	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Not bad. For a surveillance app!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I use Facebook a lot, most of the interactions are using this app, I can't imagine what i did before I got my iPhone & the Facebook app ! The improvements have been great, simple, logical steps to making it all easier to use in daily life. Well done FB	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
You can't even change the cover photo and when you put only friends for messages random people who aren't your friends send you messages. Also for the profile picture you used to be able to use more than just the thumb nail of a photo. It didn't used to be this way and you used to be able to change your cover photo on any mobile device or iPad.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I honestly used to enjoy being on Facebook more often. Some of the dynamics that have been altered or replaced have made it a little bit less fun for me. Too many ads, suggestions and fake profiles as well as seeing the same pics, game requests etc as well. However I currently enjoy being able yo upload the pics, posts etc with much more ease. I am definitely having a better time w/the mobile app too. It alllows people to have the access as they would by being on my laptop/tablet, which is obv much more "on the go" capable. Just a few thoughts and suggestions on my end.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Nicee	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Seems like I'm akwayz picking up my phone to check this APP!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Well done!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I will be writing a message or a status then BAM it kicks me out , and it doesn't show all of the messages someone writes to me, sometimes it doesn't show me any messages at all but tells me I have one!!! If this problem could be fixed that would be awesome thanks !!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It crashes on occasion, cuts the edges off pictures and takes ages to update news feed. Was good until all these 'updates' took place!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Running slow and crashes! Not impressed hence 1 * come on this app should be running smoothly by now	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I like it. It's great!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
So far good.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I use it all day, every day, to keep up with my family, friends and teammates that are scattered all over the country.  It's easy to use and hardly ever crashes.  I have a 4s and it works fine.  I don't know what all the whiners are complaining about.  When's the last time they made something perfect?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Sum times it messes up but works gd for me thx	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
this app is so buggy it's ridiculous! comments don't load, can't tap on notifications & the old favorite - can't load pics half the time without deleting app & reinstalling. I don't get it... all this popularity & they can't get it right?!? how could you even release the latest update when it clearly DOESN'T WORK??	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashing is very often since last update when using fb chat. Fix it please.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
"This update fixes all the bugs." That's a lie and you know it Fuckerburg.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Es muy bueno	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love Facebook, but the App version could be much better.  Sometimes it takes 3 tries to even get it to open!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not all my albums pops up when choosing where to add a picture too. Other than that its find. Bug fixed (kicking you off)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I love it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Compared to when I first started using it, great improvement!! Constantly improving in my opinion, still needs some work but moving in the right direction now.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Does all the things described. Just annoys me that it can't quite seem to view pictures properly. You click a pic and sometimes it freaks out on you, opens it big... Doesn't open at all... Opens and is blurry... Other then that it's just fine. Nothing to set a firework off for celebrating. Just, fine.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Amazing way to stay intouch with family and friends :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Still needs certain issues fixed such as certain search issues.. But overall it does the job..	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
The crashing is a biting and the search function takes a long while.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook is a huge part of my everyday life. Life wouldn't be the same without it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love being able to reconnect with old friends! It is so amazing how intertwined friendships are.BUT, it is so frustrating that I don't have a way to inform the developers when a feature is lost. Sometimes it's in an update, sometimes it seems to happen at random times.The locator feature is also inconsistent. Sometimes it has me located miles away from where I actually am located.Looks like the latest update fixed the crashes :-) It also seems to load faster. Finally I'm satisfied!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This no longer makes FB worth it on the iPhone. Updates are disappearing, feed  is showing promoted links instead of family updates. And the crashes...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
When I enter the Fb app, it doesn't crash until I reach the pages part. The pages app also crashes too when I try to write a post or see who liked the page. This bug needs to be fixed.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I don't like this update	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Actually the worst update!Unbelievable amount of lagging, crashing every 10 minutes, and driving me completely nuts!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It was running fine until I installed the so-called "update". Now it won't update statuses or my news feed. It runs slow and crashes ALOT. Quit updating it, you're running it into the ground. It should be called a down-date.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
All works fine here. Love the little bubble heads although I'm not a big chatter so they won't get used much.What's annoying is I sort my news feed on "Mist Recent" but when I share someone's post, it goes back to the top and changes to "News Feed" and it's proper doing my head in.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I like new format but hate all advertising and they still haven't lock up when try to upload an album of pictures. (It just freezes up. And I have super fast modem&service)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Nice	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This FB app could seriously not be any slower. It is a piece of junk on my iPhone 4. It takes forever to load and hides stories no matter which way I choose to display them. Def needs some work, very disappointing.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It keeps crashing, everytime I log on and reading post it crashes. I click on posts to comment and it crashes. Sort it now!! 	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
lucky to use the app for more than a second without it crashing.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Every time I open the app crashes! The new update was suppose to fix the bugs, but instead it made it worst...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Keeps crashing, really slow, says I have messages when I don't and it freezes	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Still can't refine the audience for posts and pics. It's often possible to read the 'share with' and 'hide from' options	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Works good! It gets rumors to flow!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I use this app more than any other. Doesn't crash for me ever	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It works fine on my iPhone 5	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Amazing app. Would like to delete or edit my posts is all (you can do it on the computer; no reason why you wouldn't here)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I like the app but it's always so slow....other then that I don't even use my PC anymore	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Crashes all the time!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
News feed seems to pick and choose what to display, have to constantly remind it to show most recent...and it takes a while to load even on wifi.Pics load slowly.If there was an alternative I'd try it but I fear this is as good as it gets right now	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Love the app.. Just wish the screen rotated when the phone is horizontal!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Stop the crashing and it'll Rick my socks.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Good app, still has a few bugs, mine often shuts itself down when I'm using it but overall a good app and does more than I expected from it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
App is super slow and has a ton of glitches. Crashes at least 50% of the time that it's opened. There is no landscape mode which makes no sense. Only reason to have this app is because it seems to be the only choice.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good! But really needs sorting in some places! Whilst trying to upload pictures or send pictures it keeps throwing me out and I have to start again, which is extremely annoying!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Great idea and works ok just needs some areas sorted out like being able to delete things and how the app crashes some times can be frustrating!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I have had many problems with this app it crashes constantly and takes long periods of time to load  pictures statuses and video then there is the net work error when I'm at full bars ? What's up with that come on honestly this is app has become a terrible experience and we fans are disappointed corrects these problems please	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Like the added sharing options but don't like how the news feed changed.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's better but wish we were able to edit comments on app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashing every single time. Feels like to uninstall it forever!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
This version of the app totally shuts down every few minutes.  Please fix.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Facebook it stinks	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
A DISLIKE BUTTON FOR FACEBOOK!! You lost 2 stats for that!! HA	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is certainly getting there	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Finally, Facebook figured out how to make an app that works! I'm well-pleased. Thank you for helping me stay in touch with those I love.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
What did we ever do before Facebook?  Favorite app by far.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
News feed doesn't load properly with the latest update	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Sometimes photos can be uploaded and sometimes not. Sometimes my "most recent" stories were "just now" and sometimes they are from YESTERDAY!!! Extremely annoying. App seems to get worse with every update. Facebook works much better in Safari.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pretty good!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Updating my review. Taking away another star. Crashes when loading almost every first try. But what bugs me the most is how I like to view things by "most recent", and everytime I switch to that view (since it never seems to remember my preference), I get about 4 stories down and see a squiggly line break and it jumps to whatever I saw the last time I logged in - which could be from the day before! I've started using a web browser for Facebook instead of this stupid app. My previous review: Does what it's supposed to, I do like the app except it runs slow and takes forever for things to load.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
When are you guys going to give users the ability to use the Facebook app in landscape mode???????	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love it!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
It crashes, lags excessively, takes forever to update when I refresh and I'll get notifications telling me of a comment, likes or whatever, but I have to refresh the feed 2 or 3 times (if not more) to actually SEE the new comment. I've been using the Facebook app (for better or for worse) for 5 years, I think? And I would have to say this is definitely the worst it's ever been for me.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Perfect	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
This need to be fix,s more Like with the photos and everything and I and make better only for the iPhones more better plz	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
the app crashes after being on it like a minute so I'm constantly reopening it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I love it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Slow, unresponsive, crashes, buggy, error-prone. One would have thought that the billions of dollars that Facebook have they could have hired people who can actually program something.Too many adverts. Clumsy interface. Messages don't load properly.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I complain about it, but in reality, it is pretty darn good.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
No crashing, loads good, very fast, picture quality is great, no complaints :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still no landscape? Why is it I'm still not able to "easily" type my messages? And WTH is with these"chat heads"? Super annoying. The more you guys update this, the worse it gets... Why must I endure the same messages with chat heads as I do with the Messenger app?? Makes no sense	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I try to get on it bumps me off. I try to write a comment before you know it I'm back to all my apps. I try to change a profile pic and it puts up a pic I didn't want. I try to delete stuff and it just hides it. When I try to poke somebody it blocks them. It's like everything is backwards. It needs to be resigned and be used for awhile before the change.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I got 99 problems but Facebook ain't one!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I think facebook should have a DISLIKE button as well. And im not the only person alot of people on facebook who think so too. Please do it!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I love Facebook. I get to keep up with friends and family. It does not get much better then that.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
My App always seems to crash :(	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I appreciate what Facebook has done for past and present friendships; making it so much easier to keep in touch, etc. What I don't appreciate is the paranoia that what I put on FB can be so easily accessed by those who I've not "friended"...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Constantly crashes, I have reopen the app and some times re-open it multiple times. It never stays on Most Recent for my Feeds and too many ads. When typing a status or chatting it slows or crashes. Also, why does it take forever to see your own status feeds, especially when you upload a pix?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app has completely ceased functioning on my iPad. I have had to go to the web app on Safari full time. What happened? An authentication problem? If I delete the app and reinstall it works for a few minutes, then the "updating" symbol just spins forever but nothing happens.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app crashes a lot! Kicks you out constantly, it's not our device it's the app! The updates either fix the bug temporarily or they totally mess it up and temp I mean a couple of min or hours....	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
So you beg me to rate you and then take forever and a day to load so I can do it? Huh, alright. Well it's improved greatly within the last month I might say. The ability to delete comments, less lagginess and the new messaging features make it so much smoother to work with.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
The only thing I don't like about the app is that the timeline isn't in chronological order. It would be so much better if that could be fixed!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
So amazing...!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
I like it very much.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I miss my blackberry when it comes to Facebook. This update is awful. The chat heads are stupid. And now I can't share posts on friends' timelines. Come on. People who are actually trying to promote their product actually work hard to make sure it's a good product. It's clear Facebook isn't trying.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

While functionality is improved, I still have concerns about access to my artist page. I can currently access it after months of sporadic administrative access and a significant lack of response from Facebook's technical support.

I like to read my newsfeed using the most recent feature. My issue is when I share a post it reverts back to the beginning and to top news therefore I am required to change back to most recent and scroll to where I was. I am using iPhone 4S with ios6	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

A good, simple app, but is always crashing, even with a simple task such as scrolling through the news feed. There are multiple issues with this app that need to be fixed!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Not crazy about it, but it works well enough.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Whenever I have just 1 notification, the icon on screen will show usually between 12-15, a little annoying to say the least	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Its all good but what it needs is a home button to go back to the top of the news feeds, floating around somewhere near by.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can't delete/ copy&paste most things on iPad!  Also I am not able to change my cover photo on my device?  randomly closes/ crashes taking me back to home screen every 4 minutes , mostly when in the middle of something then I have to wait for it to load again!!. Keeps only letting me see half of the message bubble sent from another person on chat then I have to wait for ages for it to load -.- please fix!!

Glitchy and crashes too often, but when it works it's an ok app. I wish you could edit your profile in more detail through the app though. You can't change your cover photo or a lot of other details in your profile. You should be able to interact with the iPad app exactly like a computer. Plus, I keep missing out on my friends bday announcements because they aren't shown in the app. As much $ as FB has at it's disposal, their app should be top-quality.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
If it's not crashing every five seconds, it's not Facebook! UGH!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
A few times I log into the app it does not down load properly. This has been happening recently. Some old posts gets muddled up with new posts in the newsfeed and some pictures don't load properly and end up looking pixelated. These errors need to be looked over and fixed. But overall works fine.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Can't do anything on this app I have to go on Facebook via safari to do anything on Facebook plus its really slow !!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Sheesh.  For the largest social network site on the planet, your ap blows. IF in can get this pos to even open at all, it eventually crashes almost immediately. Half the time or won't even open. Rather use my browser, and it even crashes that, too!   Crap!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Some slight problems with notifications not always showing up, but other than that there's no complaints!Wish they'd enable it so you can upload photos straight from the iPhone and tag people in it instead of just being able to show the location.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Hey guys! Let's give all our personal details to FB so they can sell them to advertisers and then shove advertisements down our throats! And let's do it voluntarily! While they accidentally leak our personal data on a regular basis!Facebook was great when it came out because it was all the stuff from MySpace that you liked and none of the annoying stuff. Since then though, slowly, it has become worse than MySpace ever was. THEN came the IPO. Now it's not even an experience. it is proverbially hooking up to a data IV so they can sell as much information about you to whomever wants to buy it. Facebook can go kick rocks.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just keeps getting better and better. Keep refining it sistas! You're doing good work.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I have very little problems with my Facebook except that I will have to reload app most of the time to get on. Then during the use of the app it will freeze and I have to reload again. It also can be very slow at updating information.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's a great place to grieve regarding the loss of my sister & Dad recently. I can show pics of them & say how I feel @ that time. Friends can look & see, but if they r tired of me talking about it they can skip my post! Still a lot of network interruptions. Always room for improvement!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Definitely improving but now crashing constantly. Was working on a write-up post for our beagle page and almost done and it crashed on me. ***********************************************Another lousy update. I respond to something and it won't even show up. Each update the app seems to get worse, I waste too much time dealing with all the bugs in this app when I could just use the desktop on my phone and be done with these problems. Here is an updated review.  I changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars. Thanks for making it that when I'm in my news feed it doesn't force me back to the top, that was a huge fix!Ok here are my new complaints:1. Very slow loading time. 2. Can't view my pages I'm a fan of, just empty boxed when I go to look at them in the friends icon. 3. When people comment on your pictures 1/2 the time you can't see what they wrote, it just shows a + box to add a comment, even if there are 15 comments on the pic.4. Get an error message that won't let post on some of my friend's status or pics but I can from my desktop.5. THIS IS A BIG ONE - When you post on someone's wall and they respond you don't get a notice they did and you don't know unless you check their wall. 6. You can't tag people in your status. *********************************************1. You can't scroll through the news feed without it automatically resetting and going back to the top. 2. When people comment on your pictures 1/2 the time you can't see what they wrote, it just shows a + box to add a comment, even if there are 15 comments on the pic. 3. Get an error message that won't let post of my friend's status or pics but I can from my laptop.4. The app will turn grey and lock me out that I'll have to reset the entire phone to get app to work. 5. Several status updates don't even show up in the news feed; I'll see them when on my laptop. 6. When you post on someone's wall and they respond you don't get a notice they did and you don't know unless you check their wall. 7. You can't tag people in your status. 8. App closes down while in it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Apparently, the world's most popular social networking site has decided that censorship is now appropriate. Allowing certain groups to bully others. I have really lost faith in what was once a fun way to share & stay connected.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The thing about Facebook is that you do need it because honestly in today's world is so hard to make those phone calls and make those text message; Staying in touch with everybody and without Facebook. It's a easy way to get that done, you do need this app ig you want to be in touch with everyone on a day to day everyday life. The The only one complaint I have is selected privacy and allowing certain people your images but I'm sure there's a way to figure it out this just needs to be more clear in the help center for that you don't get the last star but other than that: a  perfect app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I love Facebook but it has some issues..I'm not getting my notifications at all and have checked my settings and they are correct, it likes to not load my pictures from my phone until the third time, and not I cannot find some apps I have on Facebook like status shuffle. Please fix these issues. Until these are fixed I'm only giving it 3 out of 5 stars.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

1. The app is constantly crashing!2. The dates on messages sent are sometimes wrong.3. When I go on recent updates it comes up with 12 hours ago before like 5 minutes ago.4. The app is REALLY slow!!!!!!!!5. The order of the messages is very jumbled.. As a result the conversation doesn't make much sense! Things like this make me not want to be a Facebook user and make my smart phone useless! might as well go and buy a Nokia brick! at least I would be able to send a message without complications!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I am having to re-download the app since it keeps crashing. Not cool	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
New features with the update are great. Just some minor issues with the newsfeed not loading properly. When on 'most recent' still shows old posts up in the feed that shouldn't be there, also having trouble loading some pages that ends in the app crashing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

Hate the ads. Hate game requests. Love that you can now share things on other people's wall. Issues with posting comments still occurs occasionally. Overall it has improved a little however it has also gotten too commercial.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Facebook may have an outdated infrastructure at this point, and be more likely to mimic than innovate, but it's massive size makes it difficult to abandon. It's the only place to go to be able to share pictures and news with absolutely everyone. Just wish they would figure out that moving things around and copying their competition isn't the same thing as creating something new. If you want me to log on several times a day, you better find a new way to hook me, because ads for things I couldn't care less about peppering my news feed isn't doing it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Please continue to work on a few bugs here and there.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Loving this new version of Facebook for iPhone. I love how it now the option to put how you are feeling or what you are watching eating or reading. But when is going to support the new hash tag feature? Hopefully sometime soon.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Overall I like the app, my only concern is that sometimes the app doesn't update notifications, or doesn't load photos well, it might be the app, my connection, my provider, or even my phone, so I will only rate it 4 because of the errors which might be mine. Great app though!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Only good thing is the new msg bubble and the feelings.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia

Navigating Facebook on an iphone is like surfing the web on dial-up: slow and unreliable. The app hangs and crashes more than it successfully launches. Most posts aren't displayed. Photos are blurry and don't fully load. Profiles don't fully load and it is impossible to upload a photo from the iphone. Chat is about the only feature still working. Notifications now happen every single time a friend does anything. It's about time for a complete overhaul and Facebook needs to rethink just about everything.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I will rate Facebook the same as I rate Coca-cola. Once a company becomes so ingrained in your daily life that it becomes almost automatic to use it or even call other products like it the same thing. How many times have you ordered a coke only to be ask is Pepsi ok? Sure it is ok as all you really wanted was a soda to drink. Hence Facebook is automatic, Facebook is a part of our daily life until a new, faster, easier, prettier, trendier Face-thingy comes along. We neither will love it nor hate it it will just become automatic.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This media site is an awesome place for positive interaction FOR ME. Yet there are a few things that truly disturb me. This site will suspend your account for sending out friend request to people you know, whether you have numerous mutual friends or zero. Speaking for myself I am not a stalker nor do I have stalker tendencies, I was truly offended but their actions. Also, I think it is not fair that some people must use their actual names without being allowed to use their title such as Rev. Min., etc. yet others can use crazy titles such as. "Mekahismainlady Norris" who named their child that. Finally, they will suspend your account for sending out "too many" friend request, but there is no way to prevent people from sending you unwanted game request, how unfair is that?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Love this app! Use it nonstop!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm happy with it, although sometimes comments on someone's post goes missing	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
I love it, but you cant update your cover photo . What's up with that? MAKE IT MORE LIKE THE COMPUTER VERSION!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
It's not bad, the feed needs a lil improvement	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Every hour or half an hour, even, the app just closes and I have to re open it. I'm not even doing anything that would make the app crash, and I always have the apps I'm not using closed.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Facebook App just the best. Simple, easy and keeps me connected with my friends from all over the world. The new updates are making it so much easier to use the app/feature best way possible.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
No bug Everything is perfect	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
I like this app more now. Faster and sleeker.  Easy to use and less bugs and very little crashing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great way to keep in touch family and friends	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love FB, I love connecting with my friends and family. I hate the lack of control re: how much I see. - This is exactly how I began my last review of FB and I still feel the exact same way. Though FB has made improvements to tagging and major improvements to use of FB on a mobile device, they are still lacking in a significant area: controlling what I see. Because of this, they lost a star rating from me. I am tired of having to click "most recent" to see everything (at least I assume it's everything) but then it's shows me things I have NO desire to see. I don't care about who everyone has become friends with, pages they've liked, and things they've commented on. I want to see ALL (not most or some) of the original ideas (posts, pictures, and status updates) from my friends and the pages I follow in the order they posted them. Is that so hard? I am beyond frustrated that I miss about half of the updates from the pages I follow; and when I click to look at just the pages I follow, it's not in chronological order. Really FB?? Chronological order - why would anyone not want to see things in chronological order? I makes no sense. Come on FB, I'm a big fan, but this is extremely frustrating.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I deleted the FB app this morning due to crashing and problems loading comments and pictures. I have an iPhone 5 but my wife is seeing the same on her 4.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not a big fan of the amount of times it crashes on me, but other than that, I'm addicted.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
iPhone 5. The app often loses the left hand menu to change between news feed, profile etc putting them in a banner at the bottom of the screen. Looks messy and only a delete and reinstall cures the problem until it reoccurs.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This doesn't even deserve one star. It messes up my iPhone and I have to shut the phone off. Screw you Facebook app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I Enjoy Facebook!! It's lots of fun keeps people in touch!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
On my last phone I kept trying to turn off push notifications, which mysteriously, turned on one day to no success. With my new iPhone, I have declined to turn on push notifications every time I've opened the app. Really FB? You're like a dog with a bone. Stop asking!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I love facebook but these latest updates are a pain in the rear end. All this app does is shut down. I love the new message heads and the stickers are charming, just get the bugs fixed that cause it to shut down and this app would be amazing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Keeps me connected. No issues. Frequently used app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Newsfeed does NOT load correctly, no matter how many times I try to get it to show most recent items (I get 3 recent posts, then it jumps back to yesterday's). The app crashes all the time. Runs very slow. And, as everyone else also KEEPS pointing out...landscape mode would be MUCH appreciated!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
its an amazing app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I use this everyday .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I hate the FB app it keeps closing whenever  I'm chatting and someone uploads a picture my app will closed is ridiculous just to have a conversation...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Updated to this version to hopefully fix the constant crashing problems, now it crashes much faster than before.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good for keeping in touch with people on the go on my phone and checking out what's happening	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Lots of bug fixes in this one. Plus now you can add emotions.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
works well use it several times a day but can go through phases of being slow and crashing continually could do with having some features that at the moment can only be done on a desk top though	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Crashes all the time, too slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I'm used to the ever changing interface of facebook after 5 years of use. They removed a quick navigation feature from the previous version that I had come to depend on. The Chat Heads feature is worthless.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's very weird but every time I try to post a picture , it will add pictures that I never selected !!!! If I do not pay attention one day I will have one of my secret pictures on my Facebook! Scary!As for the rest it's often that my Facebook crashes. So I have to reboot my application. Or I simply have a notification but in reality I don't. It's always say :  1 Sincerely,	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Very nice interface and the new stickers features and being able to send audio clips makes talking to friends so lively!! Love It!Please add support for sending videos via inbox/chat please!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Timeline gets a bit muddled sometimes and you need the ability to delete your comments or others you don't like easier rather than deleting your whole post, apart from that its not too bad	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I like it lol	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
For about a week you had a nice little feature at the bottom of the screen that allowed you to go from one page directly back to your news feed, and you didn't have to scroll through the last 10 pages you had been on! That's gone! It's always going so slow and freezing!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nice to keep in touch whilst out and about but often crashes to home screen and runs slow on iPhone 3GS.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Overall, this version is not bad (remembering what we pay for it). A few changes to get used to, but okay. My only complaints are that it usually takes a couple of attempts to open the app, and it frequently just shuts down all by itself, seemingly saying, "Get off Facebook. You have been on long enough."  LOL	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's extremely slow... and it crashes... A lot	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I appreciate the way this allows me to keep in touch and see family and friends far away. Even in Europe.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Seriously, stop.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Nice app ever	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This time they made a good work	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love this app. I rarely have problems with crashing, or freezing. The app does what I want and I love each update. Keep up the nice work!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I am addicted to Facebook!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still closes for no reason and have to reopen again and again.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Slow and keeps on crashing. cant go an hour without it crashing. I expected more from a multi billion dollar company	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I hate the Facebook app like seriously I rather go back to the Internet to use Facebook . This app crashes way to much. When I'm scrolling down newsfeed, crash. When I'm looking at pictures,crash. As soon as I open it, crash. It's ridiculous. Can u please listen to the people and fix it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The most annoying app I've used and it keeps crashing! It does not load photos Or my wall, so whats the point??I hope they fix this problem bc I really liked this app and used it all the time! Now I can't use it at all #useless #app #facebookappsucks!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
LOVE FACEBOOK!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
You can use it to post and read statuses and all but it refuses to let you upload a picture to a specific album other than mobile. It has the option to, but it crashes when you try to. And it just crashes all the time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app is really good on iPhone 5 but it crashes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

App App keeps crashing when I'm uploading onto a page!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
SLOW and buggy. Like to crash. Still use it more than any other app I have	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am not getting any push notifications on 4s nor is my hubby on iPhone 5! All notifications are set up to facilitate push notifications but it doesn't work. Parts of conversation missing as well. Not happy	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Can't really complain about this app it helps me stay in contact with my friends and my girlfriend and family the only thing I don't like is it don't show some of my status besides that everything is awesome	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
More like broke, doesn't work on ipod4, don't download!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Not bad over all. Annoying when I have to wait to comment, uploads delayed and sometimes double of everything. But I don't pay for it so not bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Cannot link or like.  Just use FB on your laptop.  App constantly crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't seem to copy and paste correctly in the app when trying to copy a status. Something to look into. Thanks	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Whenever I go to Facebook, it crashes about 3 times before it finally goes to the newsfeed. Also, when I look at pictures, it crashes. Can someone please fix this annoying problem???	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I haven't had any issues with this app.  I like the ease of it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love Facebook but you should be able to change your cover photo on the app it annoys me so much!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I usually delay when click into picture .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's ok . But most of the time it's really slow .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Its not a big thing as much as it's not a small thing..it's an app plagued w/ problem that needs constant fixes & adjustments from time to time	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The updates are getting better for iPhone users. So far it's a good working app for me. I recommend it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This version is constantly crashes on my 4S. Never happen before in previous versions.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Landscape view will be nice	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes when i try to upload pictures! When in the chat crashes again! Getting tired to use it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Both Facebook and Facebook Pages have been crashing for no particular reason a few seconds after I open them as of today. I hope to the a corrected version soon.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It allows me basic Facebook functionality. If all those features worked all the time and it the most recent sort ever worked well, this would get more stars.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
My posts and comments constantly vanish so i must repost several times before it finally shows up. It never has post from friends I want to see but sponsored ads I could care less about. This happens on my iPhone 4 and ipad	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Use it every day! Would like a delete a post button though.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes all the time, I can't look at comments, and it won't even let me go to my home page, there is no sense in keeping it so I might as well delete it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's OK. I really wish we could use landscape in FB with an iPhone.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It won't let me upload my pictures into an album	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it great app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It is impossible to use without deleting and reinstalling the app.  This last update is causing all sorts of problems.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slow as molasses! I've abandoned the app, getting to FB via the web on my 4S.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This "update" made FB SUPER SLOWit is awful. Who is Facebook to decide that I should only see news feed and not most recent?It takes forever to go to many pages and seems to serve FB and their advertising schemes better than those using it.Have also found conservative sites load slower and cannot be shared in some occasions. Update still slow.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
J'aime l'application et fonctionne trÌ¬s bien! 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

Great site! Love it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I hate how fb doesn't stay in most recent mode anymore. Stories switch all around. Very annoying. When sharing something it goes back to the beginning and you have to start all over. Frustrating!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app doesn't open 90% of the time without having to have it open close and then open it again. I click on a name and nothing happens and it is posting everyone's comment 2-3 times it's stupid and I'm kinda fed up with Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Pero es muy lenta.  Bueno, la vida no es perfecta. But is too slow. Well, life is not perfect. Otro problema es cuando comparto alguna historia de un amigo, pÌÁgina etc, Facebook me envÌ_a de nuevo al principio de todas las noticias(timeline). Another problem is when you share a story of a friend, page, etc, Facebook sends me back to the beginning of all the news (timeline).	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's okay I don't love it I love God!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Works well!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Works fine, only issue is the app requires at least two reloads, it crashes and closes especially going app to app, it can't keep up.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
I hate the solicitation of apps & web sites I might b interested! Ur wasting my time!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I'd have given it a full five stars if you could change you're Timeline photo whilst using it.  Perhaps you could work on it for a future update??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It's great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love it it's awesome	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I do not get real time updates. In ability to delete groups or remove Facebook suggested groups is nonsense. The constant appearance of Facebook generated ads is not acceptable. Constant game requests or ad suggesting based off your martial status is bias and not acceptable... I really CANNOT stand the online dating suggestions constantly in my news feed ... The switching between groups in the feed is horrible	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's slow / unresponsive, keeps reverting back to Top Stories - why would I want to see things out of order? Why would I only want to see things YOU think I'm interested in? I can decide that for myself. How hard is it just to show posts in order? Every time you update it, it just gets worse...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Bug Central. What good is anything if you can't even turn it on properly? Too many changes just for the sake of being able to say you made some. Not easier. Not better. Want to improve something, routinize the process--like the ability to type in landscape on all pages. Half the time now I don't know what I can or can't do depending on the seemingly constant beta tests affecting me or my friends.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Always force closes -.-	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
When I leave a chat open and close the app and that person messages me and I open it to reply to them facebook freezes then crashes an I have to reopen it. Please fix this bug	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

The latest update has made it impossible to use. It take 4 minutes to look at any comments. So frustrated I am so close to closing my account!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Still crashing constantly. And the newest bit of frustration- if I share a link, it resets my news feed, messing with the organization and putting me back to the top of the screen. I don't need to see that my share went through, I want to be able to continue reading where I was without having to scroll back down 100 posts to find where I was.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nothin bad to say...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Once again we get an update that fixes one thing and stuffs up another. Fix the photo problem but it still crashes and every time you exit it goes back to the default "top stories" and you gotta start again. Let me look at what I want to look at Facebook don't try and tell me what to look at!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
There are so many things to criticize the developers of this app for, especially considering the millions upon millions of us who use it daily. The one main issue for me is the lack of a true editing feature available for text written and pictures added via mobile devices. The app does crash more than any other app I use as well. Can be quite frustrating, but its all we have to go with thus far!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It works.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Good when works - frustrating when using on mobile and find it does not show up some previous comments especially when people reply to your comments.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
You could do much better. It's alright.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I think Facebook is excellent - although the updates take time to get used to - they always end up being much more efficient :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
, I do not see any progress with the updates, with every update it seems to get worse.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I like this app and its easy to use. I only have two things that I can't stand. I don't how it is constantly slow to update and the new message bubble alerts when I open the app. Sometimes my most recent updates are from yesterday and I don't always want to read the mail in my inbox. Even if I just tap the bubble messages to see who wrote, it opens them up. This is just okay but in constant need of work.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Hate all the advertisements! I wish you would make the FarmVille game comparable with the iPad! I don't play FarmVille anymore because it isn't compatible. I am very happy that they keep up on the updates for Facebook!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app is great but needs to more in tune with most recent stuff in news feed because sometimes I got very old stuff in news feed but other than that it does what I need	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Muy bueno pero lÌÁstima que no se puede copiar y pegar casi nada	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app does not give you all the usual features so you have to log in on you computer to change any setting or subscribe to a page that you liked. It crashed a few times. It works for looking at your friends response posts. That's about it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
i have the ipad mini and when trying to update my news feeds it just wont update fix it and hurry up im not gonna be tolerating all this crap	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Shocking app, crashes every time I open it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I'm tired of the "suggested apps".  The same ones over, and over and over.  If I ignore it 15 times why does it keep popping up?  But on the other hand I never see posts that I have subscribed to or from friends. I like staying in touch with friends via Facebook so I guess I won't give up but it's definately gone 'big biz'	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Generally, a great app with loads of functionality. However, feel the latest UI isn't as user friendly as the last.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I dont mind facebook but i hate that i always have to hold my phone upright and cant use the landscape for viewing and commenting please fix! This is a pain! Also, since when does using facebook when not on wifi use up airtime?? It didnt before. Why now?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I'm ready to give up on Facebook.  The app doesn't load pictures or stories from more than an hour ago.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Couple of kinda cool features, attach a pic to a status update, message bubble.  Still hate the ads wedged in the wall. Like we don't get enough "suggested" pages already on the PC version. Figure out a better way to make money.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Not perfect but continual updates are making it better and better. What other app could you use?!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
what ever happened to landscape on FB ... bring it back. also, FB isn't allowing MyPhotos to post directly - have to go onto FB and post a pic through there.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love Facebook but this app still doesn't cut it compared to the mac/pc version.Not the same functionality or ease of use....needs seriously improving. C'mon guys!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Freezes. Slow. I have had uninstall and re install 3 times. Some posts are being duplicated 2 to 3 times on my wall. No wonder it is slow. Not happy. Fix bugs!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
When ever I go onto someone else's page it goes of instantly When I log on it goes of and it takes about for time to come on It's slow I can't click on a picture of it will go of I'm on a iPod my brothers does. The same.You need to get some bug fixes I thing	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It can be allot fun when it works. The latest update makes it crash more often.  Also, now when I click on a link I end up having to start over at the top of the news feed EVERY SINGLE TIME!  The FB PC police are getting ridiculous. If somebody doesn't like a page then just unsubscribe to it.  It's to the point where I wish there was something like FB but without all the glitches or censorship.  When a good debate gets going I wish I could post pictures and emoticons.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
When the app works, it's great. But it crashes just as often as it works... The iPad version is even worse	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I love Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It won't upload my cover photos. I've tried repeatedly with the same head banging results. Please fix!! This last update is awful it made things worse instead of better. It's a sin because its a great app. If I could give half a star I would.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Please bring back the share option to public pages. I can't share things via mobile onto the page I run. Very important for my page, since there is constant news to update. Everything else is great.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's a necessary addiction :) but I wish it wouldn't crash so much :(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I LOVE this app! It's so user friendly, I love the new feelings I can add to my posts, the fact I can add pics to personal messages from my phone, EVERYTHING!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Total crap. It has about 10% of the functionality of even the mobile site. I often have to open it in Safari just to complete the most organic tasks. Every update brings more flash and useless features while decreasing its actual usefulness. Crap. 100% crap.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Il y a beaucoup de problÌ¬me avec Facebook ! Il n'est pas toujours constant ! Une chance que ce n'est pas un logiciel de travail important !!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Why does it keep on shutting down on me pls fixVery slow to open and crashes a lotNot happy.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
To many changes bugs are still in the system. It crashes a lot. Have friends that are having the same issues. To many things released at once. Frustrating at times. Tells you that you have 10-17 new notifications but you only have 1-3 it's annoying. Social media page that's blown out of proportion	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App crashes too much plain and simple.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My app is working great! It hasn't crashed as much when I updated it. But it still has a couple bugs	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's not perfect but I use it on a regular basis	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Es una red social muy bonito y hermoso Porque en este red puedes encontrar familiares y amigos que quizÌÁs nunca pensaste en encontrarlos O quizÌÁs amigos que tienen tiempo sin verlo o sin saber nada de el Con esta red se puede localizar a cualquier amigo (a)Y gracias  a este red he encontrado a mucho amigos y familiares Y tengo muchas amistades	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook is cool you get to talk and meet people that you wouldn't talk or see in your life time....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Never crashes, and works like it should. Could Facebook in itself be better? Yes. But the app seems to work fine for what you need. So I give it a thumbs up!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I can no longer press on a photo in my group and share it with this version!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Terrible. App crashes all the time. Especially when I click a picture. Freezes and the crashes. The bubble talk is stupid. It slows the loading by a lot. Just stick to messenger and two clicks to actually go to messages. What's the point of a sore update if you keep adding stupid, and unnecessary, updates? Stick to the basics.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever since the update I've noticed that when I'm talking to people in chat, some of the messages that it says I receive via push notifications won 't actually show up when I open the app, then when I go onto my laptop they'll be there. And my news feed is also slightly wrecked because it won't refresh anymore and I've been stuck with the same posts on it for over 3  days now. The only way that it will actually refresh my news feed is if I delete and re-download the app. Please fix these bugs with the next update.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
I like Facebook but lately it's been locking up.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I had this app then deleted it for a few weeks because I was too frustrated with how it kept freezing when I'd type. I checked the App Store- oh it had been updated recently! So I re downloaded it and it still freezes from time to time but crashes a lot less. Still not the most enjoyable experience but better I suppose! Lol	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Usually the app updates are great but the last one with the NewsFeed details - not so good. But love how you listen to our feedback and get it right most of the time. Thanks	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
I enjoy it all!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

The things a like are that it's convenient, but it can be slow and it crashes often. Doesn't always open up picture files and responds slowly at times....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
ALSO CAUGHT UP WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like the app but can't keep up with the constant changes!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It is a good app 5 Starr's	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's ok but i really need to control privacy on each post, more than the limited options FB provided. Like to the specific people that i DON'T want my post to be seen.  And please stop crashing!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
They should fix the problem that I go in the app and it just exits out and when you go on search the friend and like buttons are to small and the whole thing is super slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Good way to keep in contact with family and friends!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Works way better on my iPhone 5 than it did on my droid!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes. Frequently. Still crashes...frequently.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Since its the only fb app available, we've got to deal, but every update seems to big it down so much more. What gives developers? Huh? What gives?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
:)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Enjoyable	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It keep crashing and freezing on both my iPad and iPad Mini.  Stop with the Suggested posts and all the other superfluous junk you post on our news feeds!  It is very slow! Do something to fix these bugs   All are very annoying!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I enjoy this app a lot. It has it's burps, but thankful I'm not expecting it to be perfect running like it does when I'm on the computer. So for it being on my phone I get a lot of enjoyment from it & the burps are minor.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Updates have helped. Need an option to post directly to someone's wall and tag people when posting items from news sites/apps. Still freezes and crashes often.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Since update crashing seems to have stopped! Still slow though and often displays posts out of order. Images also dont display well and take ages to open ---> old version: Crash crash crash, have to open it twice every time and it doesnt always have recent posts. Has slowed down with recent 'upgrades', and the ads are getting worse. Good enough for basic use if you are patient!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Everything I need	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Very disappointed. Cannot switch to "landscape" on main page. Sometimes the app freezes. Sometimes, while using Facebook, it'll all of a sudden close. Mark Zuckerberg, lets get with the program and stop making new layouts. FIX THE BUGS!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like it easy n fun	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The latest update stinks.  Several bugs. Sluggish and slow.  Freezes when opening pics and sometimes crashes all together. I can't believe this has not been fixed, very frustrating. Also still not seeing all my friends in the feed.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
My description said it all!!! Crashes and freeze all the time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Since last update it hasn't worked on my I phone 4s	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Love it. Need to stop making changes to it. It is how I keep up with all my family. Love it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes 3 times before it finally opens. I won't even touch pictures anymore, if the app doesn't crash first, it will freeze for a while before the picture loads. Doesn't update to show when I put a status, if it does show up it comes up twice. Get it together Facebook. This app used to run so smoothly. No one needed hash tags, you have more important things to worry about.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If you want users to stay or even new users, it would be in your company's best interest to fix the many bugs this app is infested with. I open app, see news feed, start to scroll down, CRASH! If I get past news feed to look at my own profile, CRASH! More than fingers and toes I attempt to open app, CRASH! I'm sure you pay tech support team a good salary, it's time they do their job or begin to hand out pink slips... Sincerely, a very disappointed user.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Maker me get contact with the world happy to have it Thank you Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes and closes all the time, seems to do it after using it for long periods of time, ten minutes or so. Not bad besides that.,,.like that you can use text symbols now	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love Facebook....connecting and staying in touch with friends and family. Up to date on events. The ability to reach a multitude of people with one post.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Honestly has both ruined and fixed my life multiple times. I know this sounds like a bad review but I assure you it is not. There are people I would not have gotten back in contact with that I love dearly if it was not for Facebook. Facebook is great:)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Awesom	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
6/23/2013 The Facebook icon cannot count.  It says 16 notifications, you find 3, etc.  Other than being asked rotate every little change, it is a decent app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I Ike the look and feel ... There are still some adjustments needed ... Should have a way to switch from page owner to self	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I like the previous version much better. I don't have any crashing problems, but it is to easy to get into the notifications mode if you are typing down or scrolling down, but thanks for letting me give you my opinion and for letting me stay in touch with the people I love.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The FB app is CONSTANTLY crashing and freezing.  You'd think a conglomerate like Apple would make a very popular app a little less wonky, but instead this app crashes on me almost every single day.  Same with the iPhone FB app.  Crashbook... The Facebook app from Apple.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Defiantly better on PC where it's fully functional , still a great way to communicate with family and friends that are far away	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
its ok when it dont play up :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Since the last update I can't use the app on my iPhone or IPad, it opens but the newsfeed never updates. It will show I have a new notification but I can't get to it. Worthless.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So far, no crashing issues.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have been having a problem when posting, my post doesn't show up on the first try? It will on the second time around, after I have to rewrite it. If its a lengthy post, it gets very annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes every couple of minuets when I'm trying to type messages	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Used to love this app.  Can't get it to work after the last update.  Open n close.  Restart iPad.  Even deleted it from iPad and downloaded again.  Nothing seems to work.  What happened to this app??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Quirky and ever-changing, but what's the alternative? Also feel bullied into rating this to stop the pop-up in app requests.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Feel like typing anything in Facebook? Forget it. It will crash on your every single time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is incredibly slow for me!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If you are a regular FB user you will find this convenient.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's awesome!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This is now the worst app on my iPhone !! Fix this or I'm leaving.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I absolutely love Facebook! I guess you can say, I'm a "Facebook addict."  The only thing I would like to change, is that you can update your cover photo from a mobile device. It's a pain to go on the desktop to do it. All of my friends agree! Love Facebook(:	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I just wish they could get the feed to update correctly, it's all over the place out of order, never updates with comments and likes. I do like the layout much better now.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Ever since the new update my app on my phone nor my iPad works. It doesn't load.  In fact it's still showing me posts from 3 days ago.  I have to go to the Internet to check my notifications. Craptastic update FB!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The sub-categories for friends, on the left side panel, have disappeared. Replaced with many useless options.Now you have to awkwardly scroll down through the general newsfeed to access these sub-categories. Stupid, stupid update removing an easily accessible option.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Good job with being able to do more of the desktop features but still crashes on me. I even had my phone checked to see if something was wrong with my touch screen bc this app never responds to the "tapping," and if it does it takes forever. Still with every update it crashes almost always when I go to look at pictures.  Sorry Facebook still getting 2 stars from me.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not sure what all the complaint is about. I've been using this app and all it's different versions for about 3 years now, and the app is working just fine for me, and no I don't own any Facebook stocks I don't make enough money to invest in any company. My wife and I both use this app on the iPhone 3G, and now on the iPhone 4S with no problems. The only thing I'm not happy with is the fact that the people at Facebook do not believe in the 1st amendment unless it favors the Liberals.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have to click the app at least three times before it opens, when it does open I see one persons status two or three times, I can't like or comment on anything and it will only show me a few of the most recent statuses or page feeds until it goes to the previous day. Uninstalling, not worth the aggravation.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Added more stuff. Still crashes occasionally, mainly when going on my wall using this app when i've updated stuff before hand on the web. Runs faster as well. But no most recent fix. Goes from 35 minutes ago to 7 hours ago with nothing inbetween :/	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Everything is good	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

I like FB ... What would you say?	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I love being connected to family and friends, especially those I cannot see often! I am finding it more difficult to use since I updated. I don't see birthday notices like I used to.  I cannot delete posts if I want to.  I get kicked out a lot! It often won't let me send messages (won't accept the addressee)...annoying!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I just switch from a droid to iPhone and this app is horrible compared to the droid! Takes forever to load, hard to find friends or search! It's so slow!!!!!!!! It never updates!! I miss my own family's status! Uggg	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It would be great if you could turn the phone sideways and use the keyboard.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I don't seem to have the issues others have with the app my app works just fine. I don't have to reopen the app a bunch of times to get it to work. It could be wireless connection for some people.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It tends to freeze sometimes and goes to home screen	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Awesome app. Very fast on the new iOS. Simply amazing	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Slow, slow, slow. It freezes, takes an age to connect. Notifications repeated, messages that aren't there. Since making this App more complex, it has become almost unuseable. It seems those in charge at Facebook never listen, don't like feedback and strive to make things harder. Now they have floated, money seems to be the incentive. The chat bubbles are annoying and the whole app hangs forever! Poor show FB.... but what option have we......?	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I had little issues before the update. Now, it crashes every 2 minutes, at least. It lags and loads things multiple times as if it isn't responding to itself. Before you fix this, which you severely should, triple check with a control group to make sure it works.Sincerely,Everyone	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Well Facebook you have done it again, its started crashing again, the comments are slow to unresponsive, oh and the iPhone version is damn near unusable now because you can't change from 'most popular' FB I WILL CHOSE WHICH POSTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME NOT YOU!!but at least (irony warning) it look pretty!So now the share button by default doesn't let you edit! What is going on. They actually fixed something! The share button gives you a choice again. Too many adverts and a small mountain of you might like spam for random pages. It's started crashing again on pictures. Not as random as before but still not good.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Downfalls are the pictures- can't tag, download/save, make a picture your profile default and timeline default. Fix this. Crashes a lot, too. I do not receive notifications when I receive personal messages, and even regular notifications are postponed.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app runs perfectly fine.  I'm assuming the ones with the problems are running it on an older iPhone maybe?  The only thing I wish they had was landscape mode.  Other than that, the app runs smooth.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

CRASHES NON STOP!!!! FREEZES NON STOP!!!!  Gets so bad that I can't even close the app. It freezes my phone!!!!  Go back to basic newsfeed views. All the other crap is just bogging down the system. I feel like I'm missing tons of status updates. Things disappear and then show up the next day.  I am getting to the point of not wanting to use Facebook!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes out of no where while scrolling through posts / landscape needs to be changed to turn phone sideways / you'll post a comment and it doesn't show up. Needs a lot of improvements.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Ever since adding all the options of what list to view, it randomly switches to different lists making you miss posts you want to see. News feed frequently displays out of order and needs to be refreshed repeatedly to get all posts back. Hate it, put it back.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This app is a POS. it freezes my phone, crashes, never remembers my settings and doesn't show me half my friends updates that I can see from my computer. Annoying to only see the same ppl and miss out on everyone else. What's the point!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Constantly refreshes and when I try to scroll down it just shoots back to the top. Not to mention that it make every post three times in a row and usually doesn't let me interact with any post. This new update was a horrible move on facebooks part. They launched it too early and should have worked out the kinks before releasing. Make me think less of Facebook now. All about getting more and more money. Good job Facebook, you f'd up.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Yeah, mine does crash. Not on startup, but when I look at pictures it does. If it doesn't crash when I look at a picture, it is extremely laggy. Also, when I want to share something, it won't do it. I waited 5+ mins for something to be shared and it didn't load one bit. Another thing is comments. I want to look at comments for something, nope. Just that spinning loading wheel for another 5+ mins.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I can't click on photos without having it freeze. It's quite annoying.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The Facebook app has always been a bit glitchy but the last couple of updates have brought much more frequent crashing and hanging. Time they revamped this sucker completely - or revert to the original version. Very frustrating.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Crashes, freezes, takes forever to open. Can not keep it on most recent and every time I share something it goes back to the top and reloads. Easier to just go online to use Facebook.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Why does Facebook always think they need to update things that work just fine? The new IM circle thing is totally un-needed, the new top status bar letting you know someone commented , liked , or whatever your post is already done when there is a new on the globe. Please change it back! I am to the Point where Facebook may no longer be on my cell.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

For a company who brags so much about how many people are on it, and their ads, why, and who have they hired to do this app? It crashes, doesn't load, runs slower than a snail in water.   This last update has more tech issues than an old radio.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Whoever developed this obviously didn't care enough to try. I give it two stars only because it does what I need it to. Other than that you should probably use the browser.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
A lots of updates and the crashes still the same :/	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time they update it it gets worse and worse. "Most recent" is suppose to mean minutes or hours ago not days or weeks ago!!!! I don't know why you ask us rate because y'all aren't taking anyone's advice so stop asking for a rating because you will always get 1 star and that's only cause the App Store requires it or else I'd give no stars at all.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ever since they started showing everyone what people like and comment on, it's been getting very very messy... Isn't that what sharing is for? I never see posts from my friends anymore, just pages that other people like and comment on...	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook still can't get it through their numb skulls that there are those of us that really do want to see most if not all of our friends' posts, and continue to throw hoops and hurdles at those that attempt to read everything. I can't tell which of the options I'm supposed to set my news feed to in order to see all of the posts. I can set it to "All Friends" or "Most Recent" or any of the other options, and in each setting I see posts that I don't see in the others. Very frustrating for people that use FB to keep in touch with their friends. Also, the new Messages thing where you see their face in a little bubble is dopey. They should just set it back to the way it was in the previous version. Otherwise, the app is stable and works well.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Create a feature where we can chooses if we want our friends too see what we like and comment on please. Facebook is too public!!! I know I'm not the only one.

Ever since I have updated the Facebook app I haven't had any problems except for it being kind of slow but it was worse before I updated it cause I would open it and its load then go back to my homepage and I had to reopen it over and over again I guess I don't highly recommend it unless your a patient person unlike me.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

As soon as you like something then your flooded with commercial like garbage. Facebook needs to start over from scratch.

The sort button on my iPhone Facebook continuously disappears.  Then when you choose which way you want to sort, the app changes it back to the opposite way.  Pages take a minute+ to load even when I am home and on my wifi.  The app constantly closes and posts do not show-they disappear after hitting post.  You cannot search on group pages like you can on a PC.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

When opening the app on iPhone 4 it crashes a good 6-7 times before it finally opens up. Opening/viewing pictures/picture posts it takes a really long time and often crashes or gets "stuck" in the corner of the screen with only a corner of the pictures available to see. Very glitchy. Also chat isn't showing any names at all. Had to dL another app just for chat. :/ love Facebook, need a revised app tho..	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app drives me insane. It randomly spazzes out and closes almost every time I use it. It's so hard to be patient when you have been typing for 5 minutes and then you lose everything you typed! In addition, the Spazbook app has a hard time viewing photos. PLEASE DO US ALL A FAVOR AND FIX THE APPLICATION INSTEAD OF ADDING USELESS FEATURES TO IT!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Awesome but needs more changes and fun things added to it for those of us that have had one for 5 years or more its getting boring.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook is a somewhat app, it freezes and then Glitches, it needs more maintenance ! :( and a lot of things are not able to do on mobile. Example, edit a event.  Very disappointed	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So so..	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Could be better, don't like the fact that everyday it changes and then we have to change our settings to keep up I really like catching up with friends and keeping in touch even finding new friends just wish the changes would stop	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

The newest update has left Facebook virtually unusable.  The screen freezes and it takes forever to load images.  I expect more from an app that is used by millions of people daily.  Booooo	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Dude, this update made the app slow as a whole. It used to be just loading pictures, but now it's even when updating the news feed. I've also apparently not been getting messages sent to me.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I cannot update FB ... Keeps saying "unable to download FB" wth now I can not get on my FB until I can update the app.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I haven't any issues with mine. Has everyone updated their software?  I am not liking the setting of "most recent".  Every time I "share" a post it sends me back to the beginning. Very aggravating!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Any time I consider opening this app, I have to consider whether I'm in the mood to be irritated or not. It is by far the most sluggish app on my iPhone. When it takes up to 20 seconds for each new page to load fully on a fast wifi connection, you need to revisit the way your app is written.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

The latest update had totally killed FB on my phone. My wall never loads, I get the loading circle until it crashes. If you haven't updated, DON'T! The older version may have been slow and crash on occasion but at least I could run the app and scroll through my wall. I'm on the iPhone 4.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Since the most recent update, the app freezes and refuses to update.  Then it crashes.  The update needs to be fixed.  Otherwise, it was working fine before.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Updates on status are still out of wack but not as bad are the previous version	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

The app is not how it used to be like for some pages you don't have posts by others, what the point of removing it?

App crashes SEVERAL times before it loads...and will lock up and crash frequently even once it opens. App will also not always post what I want or will freeze, etc. If I post to a group I admin most of my posts don't go where they're supposed to. App is extremely slow and unreliable at best...and fb expects me to add additional apps of theirs so i can admin my pages from my phone?! (fat chance btw) Definitely NOT worth the time/energy to download and install. Epic fail fb!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

To be honest, I prefer the old version. I'm used to typing sideways and viewing the pictures the normal way....now the pictures disappear when I slide down which gets on my nerves. And when starting the app, which crashes atleast 3 times before starting, takes forever to load my newsfeed or it shows posts from days ago and I have to completely close the app and reopen it again for the 3 times and then it will fix for a short period of time -.-"	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It never fails that every single time I open Facebook it crashes immediately and then I re open the app and it runs for a couple minutes then I click on something to comment or enlarge a photo and bam your app crashes.

Whenever i click on the app it crashes like 3 times before i can veiw it n then whenever im on someones profile it crashes you needa fix this bc right now between fb, instagram, and twitter i would put fb in third place n the sad thang is that i dont have a twitter n i very rarely use my instagram but ik they work better than this app so please fix it.

Just downloaded the latest version today(6/23/13). I hate this version! Why can't it just show me all the newsfeeds? I have to click on friends, follows, or category of people separately. What a pain! All my likes don't show up. When I add photos, it doesn't show that it's an album and only 7/20 are able to be viewed from the newsfeed. You have to go into albums and then be able to see all the photos. And those are just the glitches I've been able to find from using it for two hours!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It's amazing how quickly (relatively speaking) Facebook has woven its way into society.  It helps me keep in touch with many people and stores and organizations.  It does crash occasionally but less than before.  Is there a spell check feature?  There are so many features I haven't explored.  Keep improving, but don't leave people with older equipment in the dust.  It would help if you would begin labeling new updates to apps for whatever version of FB it will work with.  Technology is improving faster than the hardware.  So the day will come, too quickly, that new updates will be unavailable to many depending on what version of FB a customer is running.In any case, overall I love using Facebook.  Keep up the good work yet keep it people (and pet) friendly.  And I do love the cat and pet photos as long as they're shared with proper credit (if I can figure out!)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I've been getting a ton of sponsored ads from other countries that aren't even in a language I can read. I've stopped using the Facebook app because I'm sick of all of the sponsored posts which just add to how long it takes to load, the fact that it won't update (I can check and then check again in two or three hours but it still thinks a status I saw three hours ago is 18 minutes old) and I'm sick of restarting the app a few times a day.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Not bad. Could be more straightforward about privacy though. But better than anything else out there. And there's not much else out there so that's the best you can get until something better comes along. But the new chatheads is actually Chathead as you only get one and for the most part it's lame.

iPhone app crashes a lot. Will lockup where phone needs to be rebooted. Apps should be tested more for problems before releasing. They have a monopoly though if this is how you communicate with your friends and family, like I do. Would like to have another app that could interface with Facebook and use your profile with a different app.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

With each upgrade we apply this app become hateful to use, it becomes slower and slower. With each bug you claim fixing the more crash we face.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The Second Best Social App. That Doesn't include a lot of complications/navigation. The first best social app. is My Pad Plus because it includes:Twitter,Facebook, and Instagram other than having to download three different apps taking up  3x the space...	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

No real issues. iPhone 5 user here.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Since the update newsfeed will not update, keeps saying it is updating but never finishes.  Have tried removing and reinstalling with no success (however it is updated a little from the previous install).  Very frustrating!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So sloooww!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Not a bad app to be honest. Download it!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Every time I close the app, the location icon is still at the top of my screen. Why would FB's location finder stay on when the app isn't running? Every other app I have quits tracking as soon as I close it.Come on, now!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
What's up with that? Keeps shutting down. Please fix.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I think it is really good that now every time I want to go onto Facebook with this app I have to completely delete it from my phone and reload. Given that I use it as a business promotion tool as well as for keeping up with friends this is a number of times per day. This great development ensures I get just a bit frustrated every time I use the app. If this was your intention you have done well. If not, then this is not a good upgrade!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I have lately been suffering from a lot of app crashes whilst typing messages or whilst trying to load a picture into my messagesAlso reading a few other reviews I to got confused with the icon that changed for one update I think you should bring that back, the original one is getting very boring and drab	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
New updates are good but still a little slow at times and crashes ever so often. Would like to be able to unfollow posts as it quite annoying when you keep getting updates of comments added,you either have to delete your comment or log into your computer to unfollow post.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
It would be so awesome if messages had a timeline so we didn't have to scroll through to see old messages.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Now that the app runs in native C, the stability and speed is through the roof. However facebook has a habit of breaking features. Photos appear stretched and broken lately. More testing is required on facebook's end before launch I think.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

Okay so finally Facebook have rewritten the app from the ground up in object-C instead of HTML5 - that's what causes the slowness of the last version it had to constantly refresh. the new app is now native with the iPhone and should now perform faster on a whole.To highlight some of the previous reviewers concerns about the app, you can easily delete a post or hide it from your "timeline" by swiping left from the far right of your screen.Also to save pictures just press and hold on the desired picture and a menus will pop up giving you the option of saving or making it your profile picture.Just wanted to make sure that this app is being reviewed as a whole experience and for me it does the trick and is allot better than any past versions. Try it out and see for yourself!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It crashes and slows down at least 2 to 3 times a day.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook creates cracks in people's lives . With bad comments from individuals . Which causes wars and conflicts around the world .And the Facebook gets worrying monitored by the government s. how stupid do u think people are.And it's doesn't not work very good the iPhone app.So well done Facebook and well done to iTunes for letting FB and FBI have the privileges	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Well, with all th unwanted "improvement" you'd think that the FB staff would listen to suggestions; it doesn't!One thing that is drastically needed for the iPad is to keep the navigation bar visible as we scroll through the News and Timeline pages. A whole lot of us have asked for this yet nothing has been done.Another thing, it would be nice if we could EDIT our posts from pads and phones. Between automatic spell checking and finger-farts there is often a need for an edit!Minus one star:I never liked "[Facebook] might post for you without your knowledge" that is required by most of its apps! There should be an "Opt In" with the default being "Opt Out."Minus one star:The new Timeline look. Like posting without my knowledge, this should be an Opt In thing. There was nothing wrong with the old look, this was jammed down our throats in a move reminiscent of Microsoftesque and MS's Big Brother knows best marketing attitude.One more screwy idea and its So long Facebook!Why is it FB can make pages where the navigation panes on the side are tied to the main page which makes you have to scroll all the way back to the top after you have finished reading new posts?	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Doesn't update properly or play any sounds on notifications and it hangs there for a long time when loading most recent news, does not show recent comments I do not like this app, I don't want a website inside a app I just want basic communications, the app is needlessly bloated beyond belief and its causing a lot of bugs	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

Been very happy with the updates to this app. One thing I'm still looking for is the ability to turn my phone sideways and type with a wider screen.

This is extremely annoying.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I never should have upgraded to this version.  I have uninstall and reinstall the app to get my newsfeed to update. Likewise pics don't load and I can't view or leave comments on anything with a pic.  This app is utterly useless.  I cannot fathom how something that performs so poorly was ever approved for release.  If I could rate it Negative 5 stars I would.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is literally my most unreliable and frustrating app. It is jerky, it takes an age to display pictures, it closes unexpectedly, for no apparent reason.

Normally I wouldn't take the time to write a review for a mediocre app. But this time the Facebook app update is so TERRIBLE it can't be helped.Isn't there a way to downgrade?!Since updating a few days ago, the app can't manage to go five minutes without crashing. Complete incompetence. How does a company as successful as this produce software as terrible as this?If you haven't upgraded yet, save yourself repeated headaches and avoid it until they fix the crashing problem.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I don't understand how Facebook is one of the biggest social networking sites yet the the app version cannot go well without it having to crash every 3 minutes.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The notifications are poor. The home screen notifications don't cancel out when you go to the post before you cancel out. It says there's a notification then you click on it and it takes forever to update before you get to the notification. Annoying.... It's not easy to get back to the beginning of the news feed...have to hit the back button 10 times sometimes to get there.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It crashes a lot. It takes an extreme amount of time to load multiple pictures. When I tap on a picture or comment it takes forever to pop up or it crashes. I experience more crashes than anything. Sometimes I can't like a picture or status. It's very frustrating! Get it together!!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not too bad an app.It should have the same features and abilities as the original online web based app. for it to deserve an extra star.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

It works	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I still cant delete tags or photos or posts on the mobile app and now when I want to take a screen shot of a pic, I cant resize it and have it stay that way. Whenever I tap the pic (once!) to try to get rid of the writing etc to take the shot, it goes back to its original size which often cuts bits off (otherwise O wouldnt be resizing it).	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
The newest update is much better. I can now view notifications without having to arrow back through all the notifications to get to my newsfeed.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This thing crashes every time i ever leave it to check messages or do anything that isnt on facebook. Its slower than the old app by a few minutes. Anyone know if i can downgrade to the previous version? This is actually making it not worth using fb on my mobile.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

This version crashes quite often , pics take forever to load / upload and why in the hell does my news feed keep showing posts from 6 days ago ( mainly mine) mixed in with current ones ? And app crashes constantly while viewing group pages , freezes on occasion --- has to uninstall and re download it twice when I swapped from 3GS to iPhone 5	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook only works for about a minute and then quits loading anything. Constantly have to exit out of app and shut it down just to get it to load.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Not sure why it is so poorly rated overall. It's pretty slow sometimes but overall the messaging and posting are all much like using a computer to access Facebook. Status updates are generally not really up to date on the news page, lags eons behind, but notifications while slow to load are fine.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I would like to say a suggest why theres no signature like it used to be (by Facebook for iPhone )	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Horrible!!! Please fix!!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I absolutely love the Facebook app and all it's upgrades. To be completely honest, I would love it sooo much more if the landscape orientation was brought back. Please, please, please reconsider.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Lots of crashing. Can't take pictures from the "add photos" option in messages with the volume buttons. Loads extremely slow. Messages load improperly, if at all. Unstable app overall.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Having the "feeling" options is nice as well as the picture editing.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app won't remember my update setting so I have to keep switching from the default News Feed to Most Recent every time. Then it doesn't even filter the updates by time, they're all mixed together. Nearby also is useless now. I want to see where friends have checked in, not what restaurants are nearby.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Features slowly being added but still lacks the functionality of the full app. At least it doesn't crash as much on the iOS system anymore.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I dont see how this app even gets a 2.5 rating overall. Freezes constantly while other apps are performing fine, after the update crashes every startup. Wont even open. The creators never fail to let us down.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the most recent update, the app doesn't work anymore. It just hangs on "updating." I had to delete it and reinstall it 3 times, it then worked for all of 5 minutes each time before hanging again. I'm done! Deleting the app and accessing it through the Internet on my phone and iPad! You'd think by now the developers would have had their sh*t together!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good app. It lets you keep in touch with friends and it didn't crash for me. The new update was amazing and I think this app is great.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

This app works good but my problem is your friend request is faulty I had requested a few friends and family and of course overtime they never responded, but your app suspended me saying I didn't know these people. Well I do know them and your app doesn't give a great option of explanation to the request you need to fix that... Because your questions make a person feel like a stalker.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I used to like this app, then something was updated and I can't be on it for more than 5 minutes without it crashing. It seems to like crashing right before I send a long message that I have to then type again (likely several time).A Facebook app is great to have but this has so many bugs it's almost unbearable. With this new version I can't even scroll through the news feed without it jumping back to the top and creating replica upon replica of every post. I've deleted this app and re-downloaded it over and over and to no avail. So facebook: instead of adding features with every update that create more problems, how about you fix the bugs once in a while.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
They keep changing it, and everyone it gets worst. You can't see all your friends post at once, you have to go to different categories. Facebook had gone down a lot.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
great app!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Una completa basura, se cierra a cada rato la verdad una partida de ineptos e incapaces los que desarrollan esta aplicaciÌ_n ya van como 5 actualizaciones y nada que resuelven ese problema	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everyone is right. It 's getting better but it still crashes too often!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The interface of this app is wonderful, but it crashes all the time and lags when I want to look at photos/videos/posts. Fix this and you could have a brilliant app, until then I remain totally unsatisfied. Each update is worse than the last, I think it's time I start using Facebook through Safari, at least then I'll be able to perform trivial tasks without the app closing.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
It's very slow. I have to always re open the app just to use it. Then when I can finally use the app it crashes. I think there has been to much stuff added to it and its slowing it down big time.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just do better next time...	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app. Some flaws here and there though	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Slow and crashes all the time, they need to make a proper working Facebook app as most people use Facebook on a mobile device	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This latest version of Facebook is the pits.  The timeline will not update, photos do not load, and comments will not load either.  I need to constantly turn my iPad off to reset the program.  The love-hate relationship I already have with Facebook is turning into frustration-why bother mode.  Time to go back to the drawing board.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ever since the update -- in News Feed mode as well as Most Recent -- it will show a few recent stories, and then various stories from earlier in the week (like from 5 days ago). This means I miss out on many friends' posts. Please fix this issue.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I use it because I essentially have to...if I had a laptop ALL the time I would probably go to FB on there more. I even have to use the web to get on FB on my phone to get certain things done. It's not the worst, but it's not always so convenient either.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Crashing is a normal occurrence, photos aren't an option at all, no privacy controls, boring and stupid "features" that we couldn't really give a care about, slow even with excellent wifi. Sometimes I feel that developers only read reviews that have suggestions that they can do easily so it makes it look like they're actually doing something when they're really not.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

So tired of this app being slow and crashing!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Use this app for FB and you will constantly be opening, closing, reopening because of screen freezes.  FB need to add functionality That allows page admins a chance to delete photos.  We are currently a member of a buy, sell, trade page that has over 5000 photos on board so it is impossible to use the app with that much data on the page.  The admins say they are not able to delete the old expired photos.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes WAY too much on my iPhone 4. And when I go to look at pictures, it freezes and then crashes. I get excited every time I see a Facebook update...but nope, never fixes the problems!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
When can we start to reply to comments like we can on the desktop version? Also, I want to be able to zoom into a picture without it snapping back and not removing the text down the bottom.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It's absolutely mind boggling and astounding that an app used by half a billion people daily could be so poorly executed. It does not bode well for the future of the site.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Since the update, in simple cant use it, won't work, updates all the time, can't see new posts, SORT IT OUT!!!!!!!! The fact that u HAVE to rate before submit, not worth the star	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok I just wanted to say that they must have retrained their techs!  This has got to be the best update for Facebook through my iPhone!  I am scrolling with ease	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app has been improved over the years, but there are still some short-comings. You don't have all the capabilities that you have on the full website, and there's no reason for that. If you want to share something (photo, video, etc.) there is no way for you to place a caption on it. It just shares it the way it is.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Your over-40 or visually impaired users would appreciate an adjustable font size on phone app! Or at least the option to go landscape so it's bigger. I prefer just to use the browser because the app slows my phone down and doesn't allow zooming in on photos. Crashes, especially iPad version.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
All these updates and no one can make the recent post option actually show recent posts? If i want to see recent posts, my first post on my feed shouldn't be from 11 hours ago. And the ap has been crashing more than ever. Get it together fb	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
STOP UPDATING the app, it just seems to crash more and more as you release updates.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

FB is probably my most used app. I love being able to stay connected with friends. I'm not a huge fan of the way the news feeds breaks down. I'd prefer for an option to review ALL entries chronologically, which doesn't really work with the "most recent" tab	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It won't refresh my news feed or anything Just horrible	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Like this update. Pics and comments much easier to access!! However most recent post should be automatic.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Try to be more sensitive to visual impaired. We want to be involved also!  Still not able to use all your features with voice over technology. Still doesn't work well for speaking soft ware.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Whatever "upgrades" have been done recently have not been helpful lately.   The app just spins and spins instead of refreshing, it won't sort by most recent, and I can't get a photo, or comments to open to save my life...   Also I've noticed that when I 'LIKE' photos/comments via the app, they  don't appear to be LIKED when I view Facebook on my computer.  This app has become so frustrating to try and use, it may have cured my mobile Facebook addiction...   :(	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Doesn't crash like previous versions	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The Facebook application for IPhone is slow and laden with bugs and operational errors.  Try to upload a pic, get kicked out of the app.   Try to "share" a post, get kicked out of the app.  Try to tag someone it tags that person and the next "friend" down in your friends list.  Locations are way off. What a mess.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Decent app but disappointed on the lack of options in the pages side of things and it always says I've got 5 notifications when I really only have 2, other than that keep up the good work	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Overall I like the app... Wish there was a way to love or dislike something! :)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
I genuinely give this app NO STARS! ... But I am forced to give 1. What's up with crashing EVERY SINGLE SECOND? I try to type a long, important message- NOPE. WE DON'T THINK YOU DESERVE TO TYPE THAT, SO WE ARE JUST GONNA CRASH. This app. Crashes as much as the average person. That's a big number.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's Facebook	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app crashes constantly upon opening it. My feed always seems to be the same with new updates not loading. It takes a long time to load friend's pages and viewing photos is time consuming and a nuisance. They take a long time to load and usually freeze.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Difficult to rate an update as I have no previous knowledge so am learning whilst on holiday, lots of time. There are bits that are very hard like removing an older status but no doubt I will work it all out. Great fun to use though.

This app is very very well set up in terms of potential and you have access to everything you would on the computer. Although, it ALWAYS crashes but that's not the most frustrating part. News feed doesn't load, messages take forever to load, only half of your friends list exists. Very slow. Terrible app but it could be great. Until they actually fix it, don't waste your time.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I said in the last review that I loved everything but that it crashed too much... The crashing seems to be fixed, but this new feature, every notification gets a black bar over the top blue bar even if it's just because someone liked my comment... What's wrong with the red number that updates in real time and that's on top ALL THE TIME? I can see that I got a notification, I'll check it! That annoying black bar just impedes my navigation through the app 'cause it prevents me from using the navigation while it's there... So basically the app is just slower and THAT's unacceptable for a useless feature you still don't get Better than 3/5	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada

My only complaint is that I am still not confident on what I can do or not do on Facebook, but I am learning every day. I enjoy the different post and pages of individuals or groups. I don't care for the political connotations or "rants" , as I fire back when I see stupidity !I am experiencing problems logging onto FB and then I will be knocked off it numerous times , mostly early am and early evening !I am very frustrated with FB with every up-date they do. After the last up-date, I keep getting knocked of and have to tap the icon to restart. I then, have to locate my last location, only to get knocked off again. This last up-date was no beneficial to me !	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I dig it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Rubbish !! Cannot get rid of FB Spamming. nuisance FB Sites game suggestions - cannot be blocked. Enough said. FB is absolute now garbage. Even their messenger prompts messages but when opened gives no indication out of all friends who the message is from :(( FINALLY YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION & SECURITY - forget it !!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Hasn't worked in two days	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I mean, where else are you going to go?  Facebook offers users a unique opportunity to stay in touch with people that they otherwise would not interact with on a daily basis. And, that's a good thing.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Everytime I try to message someone it freezes and crashes. It's slower than before. Not happy.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Why don't you already have this?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It is in our life as a mobile phone!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
What happened to being able to share a post on a page that I manage????	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Why isn't there landscape mode? Did Facebook run out of development funds?  This should be the best running app on the market with how much Facebook makes... Ever since "bubble chat" it has froze, and crashed WAY to offten.Though this a good app, there is no excuse to why it has so many problems when the company clearly isn't missing out on funds.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Would be awesome if older posts were at the bottom. Would be awesome if newer posts were at the top of my newsfeed.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Really great Communication way!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It was just fine before the update, you'd swear that the Apps people create themselves some work by putting out an update that doesn't work for more than 1 day !!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
From worse to worse. As usual. Tired of mobile FB apps that don't work. There was nothing wrong with it initially.  But FB ALWAYS has to 'improve' it with features that don't even matter. Chat bubbles? Seriously?  I hate this app, especially this stupid non-functioning version.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time you "improve" you make it worse for the users.   Why don't you listen to the people who still use FB? People re leaving in droves.It is really no star but the comment ill not post without one.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love the app but the bug fixes didnt work.. Almost everytime I try to use chat, it cancels me out so I have to go back into the app a second time almost everytime I open it. FIX IT	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Too many adverts on it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Love it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Please sort it out and ill give 5 stars. Crashes while I'm writing messages to people, then I have to restart and write all over again, that's pretty annoying. Hope u consider all the complaints about this, I'm not the only person.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The new updated version doesn't tell the correct time last active. The old version would say "13m" or "36m" etc. this one says everyone is "1m" then jumps to "1 h". Makes no sense!!! It doesn't account for the time in between that hour now!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Thank you! I ‰_ it! ))	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Not sure what the latest update has done but hardly works now. I've just deleted it to reload to see if that makes a difference. Rubbish at the moment	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

My News Feed now doesn't work.  Clearly not tested before launch.  Each new version seems to get worse!  Wish I'd not updated, don't think I can go back to the previous version now.  Sort it out.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I already uninstall and reinstall Facebook app for three times and is showing me like a web layout, I have a banner at the bottom of the app where it shows me the news feed, notifications, friends, etc. I don't like this new update!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Crash city, annoying layout, won't take you to home page when opening	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With the last update the app will not update recent feed. I have deleted and reinstalled it several times and still no luck. Just wondering if this is happening to all or just mine? Hope there is a fix soon.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am always on this app keeping in touch with family here and far away. I like the added new features but I would like the Event view ability coz for some reason I still have to go to Facebook online to view events. But other than that, I really do enjoy this app!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashing all the time now! Stop adding crapping gestures that slow down the app!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Frequent crashes (though with no discernible after-effect but anger). Slow starts on a 4S. Can't copy content out to share as I see fit. Ugh.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I enjoy the added functionality of the new version but it is remarkably slow. I've gone back to using the mobile web-page.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app keeps crashing on me, gets annoying when I'm half way through writing a messages and statuses. Also noticed that it will say that a friend was online 1 min ago when they wasn't.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
You should be able to add whomever you want. Its their choice if they accept you or not. Or else i would give it a5	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This is an absolutely disgraceful application. It doesn't work whatsoever and is extremely tedious to use, as it crashes constantly and has too many animations that slow everything down.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't even comment back to people on a post I made. The city I live on is flooding all over and telling my friends and family is such a chore I'm going to have to turn on my laptop to do it. Epic fail for convenience.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Yep, yet again the app doesn't update. Even after dragging the screen down many times, on wifi, the timeline doesn't update. I compare the app to the web and there is a lot of posts missing from the app. There is no shortage of ads though. Thank you FaceBook å¨ Mobile App for failing yet again. Keep up the great work.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook is a huge company that brings in significant amounts of money. Does anyone else find it ironic that it's the worst app on the market???? It never loads things properly, tells me I have notifications when I don't, doesn't show me information the website does, doesn't provide crucial functions such as untagging photos from the cellphone app or changing the profile picture from one in your camera roll, and it asks me to add/"update" information to my profile everyday and I have to skip through multiple steps. All these stupid problems should be fixed and I have no idea why they haven't already.....	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I'm surprised when the FB app stays open on my first attempt to open it. And if I try to open a link from within the app and don't immediately select "open in Safari", the page I was reading and the app crashes.

EVERY time I open the app for what ever reason, pictures, videos, status updates, chat, messaging, or just looking at my news feed, it crashes. I can't even search a name or page anymore because within seconds of opening the app, it crashes. It's very frustrating because I have to open up my Internet browser and go to Facebook from there.

Never had a problem with FB on any device I've been using! Easy to use if I ever have any problems with the site I will contact FB, not had to do as yet!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
"Don't Like"	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Horrible! Pages won't load and I've had to uninstall reinstall several times because it freezes up.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
You'd think after updating this app about 10 times in the past 2 months all the bugs would be fixed. Nope. It closes down on me all the time. When you click on stuff, sometimes it works & sometimes it doesn't. Photos take forever to load since the update. You cant always delete posts. And I hate that you can't see the hearts anymore.. I'm about to delete it & just use the browser because I never have problems with that. Come on apple/Facebook- get it together! ;)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Early on the app was very slow and limited in functions. With the constant updates, the app is improving and you can so most of the things you can do on your computer. I use it everyday and it gets me through my long commutes in the morning. It's fun reading all the updates ppl post, from family, friends and pages that I 'like'.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Sometimes posts appear duplicated and other times comments appear not to get stored. It has also shut down unexpectedly. Overall not really impressed.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
No matter how many times u upgrade it...it keeps getting worst and worst it crashes too damm much	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It keeps crashing up. Freeze several times close unexpectedly. Overall, newest update isn't as great as the old one 	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I Like Facebook because it has allowed to to reconnect with friends an make new ones :))	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook has improved except that on mobile other people should not access to your friends list unless you permit them to! Also there should be a easier way to suggest friends! There are a few more quirks but Facebook has come along way!!!Also it crashes a lot and I get banned too often trying to make friends even though other people have thousands of friends!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I use this app everyday so I really don't care but I like it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app still shuts down from time to time but for the most part it has been easy to use. Don't really dig the conversation bubbles but it is easy enough to get rid of them, of course they are black the next time you open them up.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I am tired of how FB is trying to control everything. I am sick of you telling me to stop typing so fast and delaying me answering my mail because I type fast. I have thousands of friends and have many chats open too. Grab a clue and fix your security for people like me that are NOT spammers. Figure it out. I tell everyone about this issue and can't wait till there is another site that can be utilized without this issue. I will then get all my 4,500 plus fiends to move there as well.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Some resources from desktop version are not available.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Photos do not appear correctly (seems like they are zoomed in and cropped; some occasions it freezes completely and becomes clunky). I haven't had much problems previously before update. Now I find myself re-downloading it to fix the problem(s). Please Facebook sort your stuff out, hundreds of millions of people must be using this app; one would think to conduct extensive checks to ensure user experience isn't compromised and not use the masses to check for you.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

Well, i cant view messages, i cant reply to messages, it takes 5 minutes to refresh my news feed, cant view any pictures, cant comment. Using safari for facebook is faster than using the app, come on developers, you can do better	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Their new update didn't work. It just keeps refreshing the page and doesn't let me click on stuff.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My Facebook app on my iPhone 4 stinks. It is VERY SLOW, it hangs and most of the time I have to open it 3 or 4 times before it works. I never had these problems until the last 2 or 3 updates.   I hope Facebook can fix these problems.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It lag when I scroll and lags when I open or get off it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sort it out yet AGAIN every time I check status of people it's pot luck what I get "news feed" or "most recent" when I pick which one i want I want it to stay that way until I want to change it. Most frustrating.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

This app has crashed idk how many times. It freezes then closes & does it 3 or 4 times before I can open it. I don't get all my notifications, then It tells me I have a notification and I check & I don't & I can't clear it. Facebook app is useless! I use safari more.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
A racist called my boyfriend a typical slang word. I responded to what she said to defend him, repeating the word she said and put it in quotes. They kicked me off Facebook for 12 hours. They didnt kick her off.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It crashes more often now! Seriously, what's wrong with ya'll updating, adding new features yet can't fix the bugs and stuff. Smh! Won't be surprised if there's gonna be a better app than this, soon.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I've already had a few friends who were almost killed by the flooding and I would like to know what is going on without having to reopen and re-scroll to the bottom of my newsfeed to confirm people are OKSo please fix the CRASHING!!Also, have u not noticed that with each update u are changing the stars are going down? Please fix it, make it work and don't make it worse because I u put ur mind to it u could make a great app instead of making it worse‰Û_	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I have no prob with the Facebook app, I just have one request for an update.  I create Photo Albums on my iPhone with pictures, and id like the option to upload these albums onto Facebook directly, instead of having to go thru all my photos on my camera roll and re-select them.  It's super annoying to re-select all the photos after I've already chosen them for an album.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It works fine to me. It does pop off sometimes when I try to get on fb but I think that's my phone causing it. But to me I like it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Quite a lot of glitches and it crashes	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
The new updates are great and the app is overall very well made and mug quicker than it used to be.My one complaint would be that when you click to post your status, the keyboard doesn't pop up automatically. It used to. If I want to post a status, I need the keyboard and not photos. Otherwise, I would tap on photo to post a photo. Other than that, the app is good.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
They finally gave the users the ability to share posts, took them long enough. I haven't had any problems with it crashing like other users have mentioned.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes like no other. Have to open, reopen, force closed, open... Til it sticks. If I'm lucky it will stay open eventually. If I was in the middle of posting something when it crashes, I'm SOL. CRASHBOOK	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Never any problems. Newer version is a lot more user friendly. I love keeping in touch with my family out of state. This makes it so easy!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's not just once in a while that these crashes occur. It's every single time you open the app. The next update should really address this issue.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Scrap the new update and make one where you can take a photo from the iPhone and make it your profile pic on the mobile app. I agree with a previous commenter as you have ruined a good app. It also always crashes. C'mon it's still horribly slow so fiiiiix thiiiis!!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

When this app isn't constantly crashing, I seem to keep having network errors. The thing I don't understand is I have perfect service and am connected to wifi. Everything else works, so why can't I look at my messages or anything? It seems the "better" you try to make the app, the worse it gets. And to top it off I had to jump through hoops to submit my review that you have so desperately been asking me for.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Excellent app, easy to use and faster to load. Need to improve picture changing and able to save picture like it was before	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

I like the chat feature and looking on the news feed is ok too. I don't like the fact that you cannot, or at least I have not found out how to, change the banner picture using the app. It does seems to crash every now and then. I do not like the chat bubbles, they are distracting to me. I would much rather have a chat area that you could click on and enter into a chat room. I also wish they had multiple chat so that three or more people could chat together in one place privately. I like the group features of this app. Overall, It is 50/50 on pros and cons.

I have been trying to download photos from facebook to my ipod and everytime I go to my photos on facebook the app closes. This happens frequently at other times too.

Facebook is a social media that has been very helpful. But it has also cause problems. There is a lot of drama. But I guess that's involved with the people I'm friends with no Facebook. It has lost many accounts due to new social medias. And it's just going down hill. I have deleted my account over five times and made a new account. But Facebook also has some bright sides to it. You can share with friends. She what everyone is talking about. Talk to friends. And have fun.

Very slow, I miss thing! I do like that I can see who's online at work!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I like the app, however it crashes a lot on my iPhone. I open the program about 3-4 times and itll crash all but the last time.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
A must have	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
When i want to look at a picture, it's so slow it takes like 2 minutes to just see the picture. Not the loading ciecle. That doesnt take too long. Please improve.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook's apps are notorious for weird choices, but the new drops own alert thing is ridiculous. It pops into the way and if I am in the middle of writing an update and accidentally tap the stupid pop up, I lose what I'm doing. The text in events in non-selectable. If I want to copy and paste an address from the event into a map application or email to someone else, I can't. It keeps just trying to open crapple maps. I can't select any text from the description either, which is stupid. You all spent so much dev time on the silly bouncing chat heads that you didn't notice the basics. Or was selecting text disabled for some inexplicable reason?	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great graphical user interface and I must say its an excellent app. The chat bubbles were a good addition. The only thing that I find annoying is that you can't change your favorites in the chat bar.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Since last update the Posts are all mixed up when you select most recent. Most recent to me means they are in order from latest post and so on. Pretty crap	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I wish u could upload a video from the app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It crashes every single time	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This is a great app very easy to use use it all the time just keep putting in those good updates and don't mess this thing up.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Its not that good i hate chat heads sometimes because of the constant crashing and it moves so slow I really hate it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Truly connects u to the world	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Easy to use. A lot more intuitive.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It works, kind of. If you really want access to everything Facebook has to offer, use a web browser. The app is quite frankly an ugly kludge.You'd figure a company this big could produce something half decent, rather than half baked.The most recent update hasn't addressed the issues with the application. It is still a kludge. Wayne	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

Crashes a lot. Seems they are slowly trying to make it better though.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I know this is sad but I check my fb every sec of my life it allows me to see my mates latest updates it's ace. But fb causes major bullying (cyber bullying) xxx	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I would rather I could manage who can see my posts as in customising privacy on an individual basis. Thanks!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
PROS - The share feature is much better now -  I can finally share to my page, as well as timeline and friends.  It is expedient to have the comments open on the same page, rather than have to wait for a whole new page to open.CONS - it freezes and crashes more frequently than before.  Opening new pages still goes slowly.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
When I am on and try to load my newsfeed it can't load new posts.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is a complete waste of time. First of all, loading "most recent" stories takes forever and it still seems to show stories from a week ago. Loading messages takes for ages, and it often crashes. Facebook on a computer is 100 times better. FIX IT.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Pretty good upgrades each time	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love FB, but if u guys could dosomething about the crashing and freezing up almost everytime I click on a picture that would be great. Other than that it's cool.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm sick of this annoying bug where when I check on a notification that takes me away from the news feed, and then I hit the back button to return to the news feed, the app locks up. I can't scroll up or down or hit the black bar on top to zoom back up. I have to close out the app and go back on every time.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
With all the new updates it runs very slow.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Once I'm actually able to open the app and it stops crashing, I'm no longer able to actually view my messages. If i try to scroll to much it will freeze or close the app and its practically impossible to go to someone else's page. I don't see the point of the app if nothing works.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works perfectly...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
As far as I am concerned this is the best social network that I find the best of the best & I love it!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It keeps me connected with my frenz and family! That is all I need;)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app has always been decent but please get rid of the chat bubble, unnecessary and annoying. Please, pleasr add an unfollow post button to mobile! I don't need updates every time someone else posts in a friend's update.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Stupid app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My app constantly freezes up, or is extremely slow, and sometimes just automatically closes itself. I'm really not impressed.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Good app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Great, updated facebk but now it won't update!!!!!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Crashing upon opening post in status.Sluggish on all featuresVery slow on iPhone 4Still sluggish & crashes.  iPhone (4)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My Facebook app keeps freezing and closing....Doesn't open some videos.....I don't like the new chat with the bubble things.Other than that, good app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
OMG the facebook app is sooooooo broke, it's always crashing. Pleeeeeeeeas fix the app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Quit changing everything. Yes I agree I don't need your biased top stories.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Face book is great for keeping up with your friends and news. I am having problems of being slow once in awhile opening up on my iPhone. Also there is times where it will not come on at all on my iPhone. Now there is times it completely closes you out, and times you have to reopen more than once.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app is 100% perfect and its only 4 stars but I can't delete the albums because on my blackberry,when I log in on the browser/fb app it shows the albums eg: some are empty and some you want to get rid of and if you can keep everything the same in the app but the only difference is you can delete albums which is a good positive thing then I'll rate your next updated app with  my suggested feature 5 stars and I'm not lying because I really want my my empty albums to be deleted but your current version won't let me.And also it keeps crashing sometimes on the app on my phone when I'm trying to login.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Even with the latest update , this app crashes ALL THE TIME. Get your act together millionaires at Facebook and do some actual work this time and FIX you app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Loving the new updates not having a single problem with it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This new update is even worse than before! Lagging when scrolling through the news feed on my iPhone 4s. Whenever i click "send" button while chatting, it freezes for more than 10 seconds. Also after opening a photo, the app either crash or freeze, i have to re-open the app everytime. This update is weird. Thinking to uninstall it soon.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Dislike the circle pop-up when you get messages. Why not stick to old method of a red 1 when you have a message beside the message envelope?Also annoying that you can't view interest lists in app. AND it sometimes randomly kicks out & goes back to home screen. That's agitating.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Fix the photo, i have a small auto-zoom..	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Please continue to treat the app as an alternative to using the desktop version.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Bravo  les avis sont fatiguants	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Every time I tag someone in a post, their name shows double, after I post the message. Lame.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's ok still seems to lag at times but doing a ok job. And for that we thank u...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
So it seems that I'm not the only one experiencing constant crashing with this app. Really, Facebook, really? You can't even stay open for more than 3 seconds. No wonder this app isn't as popular anymore.. It crashes as though its programmed to do so. It's happened so much that I made it a game and timed it to see how long it lasts before it crashes.. In other words, I can't even use it for Facebook anymore!! My advice, just trash the app and use a browser.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Mine doesn't even work! Fuming. Really bad update	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I love being able to know about and chat with my friends and family!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes way too much. I can't use it for more than five minutes without a crash.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Works really well and is easy to navigate through	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Nice	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Sometimes pictures don't load	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Yup	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love Facebook. I wish it had a dislike button though. But I hate when you click on Facebook and the app will go off	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's great for freinds and old class mates and just an great site ‰_	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Finally hit the spot on technology, I like everything about it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It constantly freezes up and takes forever to come back. Getting so tired of it. Thinking about just getting rid of it with the so many bugs anymore. Takes to long to load anything. Not happy.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
woo.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Can't update the cover picture! However on iPhone it is possible! Please add this option!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Facebooks change my life it's AWSOME all I do is be on fb!!!!:)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It keeps crashing, but everything else is pretty cool.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest update seems to be much better for the 3GS, so credit when credit is due.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
My most used app! Not perfect yet but get closer	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I love the whole idea of Facebook, and I really enjoy using it. However, I absolutely hate the way Facebook is coming up with repeated changes which risk our online security. Thank goodness we have people like Kim Komando who stay on top of these issues & immediately advise us on these changes & what to do asap to protect ourselves!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Does not show most recent, does not show all posts! A lemon!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
This app is so awesome because you can do everything on it like you do on a computer (: You can upload pictures, videos, talk to friends, anything you want (: I would get this app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Sometimes it's a decent app. At other times its a shocking annoyance. Takes ages to update,double publishes,still gives ridiculous options. But you know you stick with it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
What a mess, it does not update and shows posts out of order!!!! Like the staff reviews, is it really that bad you have to have staff on saying fantastic when its running like crap.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Improvements on messenger would be nice.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Always changing. Always got to be concern with the security of my info.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Always crashes when I look at my own profile or friends profiles. Can't even change things in my profile because it crashes before I get a chance. Please fix this app so it does not crash when people are using it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Every time I want to share or write a post I have to make sure it's done posting because if I try scrolling through the timelines before it's done, it bumps me up to the very top. I then have to scroll back down to where I was. Not really a big deal, but it can be annoying when I only check my feeds once a day and have to find my place again. It's done this throughout several versions now. iPhone 5, 6.1.2	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm giving it 3 stars because I can get on the app and do some things but every time I want to view a picture it's fuzzy. Aside from posts people write I'm lucky if I can view the picture they tag along with it. Very frustrating! Also there needs to be a DISLIKE button. I'm sure many have said so but there are so many posts that I'm sure people would love to hit dislike instead of like on. And if I am the first to say this I should be paid for thinking of it. Just an idea. Keeps crashing on me!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Terrible app, too many problems to list individually. Ignore this app and access FB via your browser	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
App runs slower than ever. I can't even load the app past the initial news feed page. Good luck if you want to see anything other than the last 10 minutes of news feeds.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it ;)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia

Big big mess with life events!!!!!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I really don't care for add ons, what I care for is performance upgrades and I was able to notice a significant performance gain from the previous version.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The FB app has been kicking me off for weeks. It's now even worse after this update!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Good job	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Get it	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Finally stopped crashing every 10 minutes. 	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I dislike this system I don't not want people know that!!!!! Others have really good improvement tho	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Latest versions have made it grind iPhone 4 to a halt and drain battery. Deleted app and reverted to mobile site and battery problem has vanished. Oh and as for the unbelievable amount of ads... Absolutely dire.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It ok	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Please sort out the chat, there's a favourites but I can't edit, it's simple to sort it out so please do it	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I like how you can upload photos to Facebook right from your iPod/iPhone.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can you make it so that you can delete pages that you created, i cant be admin on another page because i have too many pages created, please fix it	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Instead of making it "better", why don't you fix the problems it has.. Keeps crashing. Please fix!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
LANDSCAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Morons who program this app. Why are you so stupid!?!? LANDSCAPE ORIENTATION IS BASIC FUNCTIONALITY IN IOS. It was there initially! Why would you take it away????	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Butts.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Does most of the things you want.Please bring back the ability to set your news feed to display most recent posts. It gets annoying having to set it to that each time I use the app. Apart from that it's a good app. Could do with quicker loading times.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Why can't we just have most recent actually. All the stories since my last visit chronologically. Pre set as a rule. I am so sick of missing what people post because this app chooses what the "top stories" are. I'LL DECIDE WHAT ARE THE TOP POSTS FROM MY FRIENDS ARE NOT YOU!!! Please.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Decent update but still Would be nice to "share" photos and post them on an individual friends wall. but No problems at all,  does what the update says for me!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I don't like it one bit!!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This update finally replaced the correct layout of the app for me	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I liked the update before this one	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't open my messages :(	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
My Facebook is crashing and it crashes at least 4 times before I can use it as well as the Facebook messenger. Could you please fix it for IPhone and iPods. Thanks!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Ok? Y'all still didn't fix the problem where I can't change my custom audience from my status update!!! It used to be there and now it's not! What the hell man? What's the point of the update? I don't want just anyone looking at every last thing I have to say! Now I still have to open safari if I want to censor my posts! FIX PLEASE	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
No cambio ni mrdd	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
It's a nice app. I like it.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
There is no way of giving a caption in a profile picture or cover photo directly	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I love this new update its just like my iPhone ‰ÏÎ	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I can't see the Recent Posts by Others and albums on fan pages with the mobile version for iPhone. Please fix it and put the icon.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Every time I look at pictures this app always closes on me! Why!?!? Please fix this bug because I'm getting really frustrated with opening and closing the app all the time.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
C'est tout.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It keep going well since the last updated. But I want the app to supports background image in chat as well as many other social apps that allow user to put their own background.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Since the iPhone 5 got the new updates , it seems Facebook has too, however I'm not sure if there is a problem with iOS 6.1.3 as it often suffers from crashes and freezes. Prior to the last couple of updates it worked fine. I assume Im not the only one having this problem	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
With each update this app goes backwards. Useless.Still no recent post by other.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Sim, semi-funcional! Pois dÌÁ muitos erros, e chega a dar respring quando eu tento apagar! Reiniciar o aparelho sÌ_ por causa do facebook nÌ£o Ì© uma boa alternativa, pois nem sempre resolve	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook was ok sometimes it would randomly just go of an back onto your ahomescreen of your divice and it would freeze a lot.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's a great app but I would like to be able to turn my screen sideways and/or upside down. I can't use it properly now because of a dodgy screen.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
This app is becoming, the most efficient one of all versions released.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Will not update! Had to delete app and try again... Still nothing!!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Bring hashtag support	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Liking this update seems to be very smooth	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Every update makes the app slower. It is so slow now that I stopped using Facebook on my phone completely! They really need to re-write the whole app and make it faster instead of just dumping features on it.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slow! Can't see my updates! It's just awful!!!!! Keeps shutting down! Can you please put in a custom option in the privacy settings? And post editing without having to delete the whole post.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I don't know when I leave Facebook chat it still shows active which is very stupid. My friends tells me ignoring them.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps crashing when I try to open it since the new update.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works fairly well on the iPhone, but when trying to reply on the iPad, I can't see the text I am typing. As I have 2 Facebook accounts, one for work and one for pleasure, I would like to be able to access both accounts easily from this one app.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Me encanta estar en contacto con Mi Familia. Y fb me ayuda en eso :-)	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	New Zealand
They have a share button but every-time one uses it, the app flings them back to the top of the newsfeed.  Stupid.It still does this and it's still stupidAnd it keeps changing the newsfeed sort.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I can't download. This isn't working. And i can't get into my Facebook page. Please fix this now please!!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app has a lot of good qualities but its constantly freezing and crashing and it takes forever to load. This is the main reason I'm never on fb and it needs to be fixed	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app now lacks all common sense elements of good design and flies in the face of what a GUI should be like.  Problems too numerous to describe here.  I'm left thinking that the software design team is a bunch of morons at Facebook.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pathetic. I can't even get the app to open at all and I've deleted and re-installed it many times and still nothing.! Optimise the app for iPhone 4S and other devices, not just iPhone 5!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Plz bring bak the old layout-much cleaner and easier to navigate. Wanna downgrade version....	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

LONG overdue on being able to change the privacy settings on posts via the app.  Still wish there was a way to edit posts after the fact for spelling and typos.---------------------------------------Update: 4/17/2013Oh Facebook - you release yet another app update and fail to communicate to your customers what you've fixed.  When will you ever learn?I guess someone figured out you left that part out because I see a new sentence has been inserted to the release notes & version history. Sheesh.-------------------------Update: 4/16/2013New version seems decent.Regarding news feeds:  I like that we now have an All Friends view.  That view was removed from the web version quite a long time ago and I think it's led to a decrease in friend to friend interaction.  I've heard it's back in the updated news feed for web, but I wouldn't know since I haven't been upgraded yet despite signing up on the waiting list the day it was released.  Also regarding news feeds:  I have at least 30 interest lists and now they are all mixed up in the list.  Shouldn't I be able to rearrange those lists or at the very least, they should be displayed in alphabetical order??I agree the "new stories" popup is a bit intrusive.  Messages: pretty cool version of multi-tasking since you can have a message open and scroll through your news feed without losing your place in the message, or the ability to have more than one message open at a time.I would still like to see a landscape viewing to have a larger keyboard for typing comments and messages.---------------Update: 11/6/12Still no landscape view, can't edit my own comments, newsfeed isn't show the most recents posts in chronological order, even though that's what I have selected.  And worst of all, the app constantly loads.  Scroll down the page a little - app loads, scroll more, app loads some more.  I really haven't noticed any of the upgrades in this new app although I'm told there are some.--------------------------------------This new version is great!  Haven't had any crashes, it's fast, but I'm disappointed they've taken away the ability to use landscape view.  Also, I've hidden almost every game and app posting on my regular Facebook newsfeed and yet the FB app is still showing them.  The app should honor all the display & privacy settings that are programmed onto the main site.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This new app is great! At 70 years young, I am suddenly able to be shown once and can remember how to do something on my IPad2.Good Work Guys! There's hope for me yet.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Fix the crashes on pop up's chats in the messenger. Fast!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So let me get this right, you've just updated the app. And Im expecting no more crashing, but no, it's still crashing. I'm typing long paragraphs to my friends, and suddenly the app crashes, do you know how frustrating that is? And it happens like 50 times a day, and I have to type these long things over and over again. Please just fix the app..!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I woke up half an hour ago and I've been using Facebook in that half hour, and the app has crashed 5 times. I hate the new app. I want to delete it but I can't because it's hard to use Facebook in the mobile website. PLEASEE fix all the crashing.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
You should make it so that people can watch videos on the iPhone. You can't watch videos unless you scroll on their timeline. There should be an album that others can go to.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
You have a sub standard app here, it used to be ok at best, but now it has become nothing more that a hassle to use! Its slow, it crashes and i if i want to view a picture it kicks me off alltogether! It needs sorting you lazy slobs!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
La peor App, se traba, no puedo ver chats, las fotos tardan aÌ±os en entrar, siempre que sale actualizaciÌ_n dice" soluciÌ_n de errores" y siempre estÌÁn los mismos errores y mas	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
WHY DID YOU TAKE AWAY THE LANDSCAPE OPTION FOR WRITING STATUSES AND COMMENTS?!?!?!?HAVEN'T YOU HEARD OF REPETITIVE STRESS INJURY? USING MY THUMB TO WRITE EVERYTHING IS GETTING TIRESOME. AND IM USING YOUR APP LESS AND LESS...	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Good app, just crashes constantly. Afterwards my keyboard shortcuts don't work.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app doesn't even work. It launches then crashes before anything gets a chance to load. It launches for literally 1 second then crashes right away. Tried deleting and re-installing. Nothing works. Fail...	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I am so loving the Facebook for iPhone app. It has really improved. This update totally rocks!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still no posts by others? I hope you guys are not getting paid for these updates	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
What's the point of landscape view if this app has no support for it?	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
App takes forever to load a d freezes at least 3 times a day, forcing me to restart. This started after the last update, I thought updates were supposed to make the app better, not worse!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Just downloaded the update released 18june'13 and now FB KEEPS CRASHING. way to go.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Thank u	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Is more problematic now. Real issues with posted pics. Usually start off blank and load really slowly or force closes the app when clicking on them.  Also clicking on comments takes forever to load. Seriously not as quick as it used to be. Needs some adjustments badly. Sometimes doesn't update. Frustrating app now.  Crashes frequently. :-(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great update I really enjoy it xD .. Keep up the GREAT work!! And the bugs were fixed.. Awesome	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love FB app. New and improved	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good app, good layout and all, but you need to fix the crashing. Every time I open the app and stay on it for about 2 minutes, it crashes and closes down. There had been an update but it still crashes. FIX IT	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I am about to uninstall and reinstall it again, the 3rd time in 2 days. It stays stuck on "updating".	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
With each new update the app just gets slower and slower and more unresponsive. I dread updates. Gotta live with it though.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

It could be better. Seriously	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Slow. Slow. Slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app has gone down the drain...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like it, it works well. It's easy to use and I haven't had any problems yet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
There have been some bad updates to this app but this one takes the cake ... Constant crashing ... Comments disappearing ... Takes forever to load a message ... Make the bubble thing optional ... Please just fix the constant crashing and poor loading urgently	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
A few glitches like any app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Great Social App To Keep In Contact With Others Around The World! :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Buena aplicaciÌ_n, buenos grÌÁficos	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still crashes and hangs. Daily.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I use this ish everyday, and every feature never always works, but the new features being added offset the hooplah. Unfortunately, irreplaceable.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Sure it was awesome last month, but now it's just horrible, it crashes 20-30 times daily, it lags at recieving messages and sending pictures takes multiple tries (around 10) sometimes. Pictures that you post sometimes don't even show up on your timeline, photos, and activity log.It's a good app but it crashes too much, lags, and has too many bugs	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Awesome App works flawlessly on my iPhone 4.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like the new changes but its a little slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Realmente muy acostumbrado a esta aplicaciÌ_n. Lo mejor, estar en contacto con muchos amigos y familiares.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love using Facebook and everything, but they way they have updated the app makes it to where it crashes.All. The. Time.I would be nice if it wouldn't, you know, crash when I'm in the middle of sending a really long message.And another thing is, when ever I try to post a comment from time to time it hardly goes through! Then I get paranoid that it will post the comment 600 times a few minutes later.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Excellent	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I love Facebook it's amazing<3	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The Facebook app is atrocious. Freezes up, crashes, takes forever to load, becomes frequently unresponsive. Great job making a terrible app. You'd think with the billions of dollars Facebook is worth they'd be able to make a simple, functional app that doesn't take forever to load.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Awesome	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's just ok.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Does what I want it to while on the go.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app except that it crashes, daily. Also not overly thrilled with the latest update but that is minor. I find it crashes multiple times, daily. Very frustrating as I then need to scroll all the way through to get back to where I was. Please fix this and I will gladly rate you a 5 star app (:.Okay folks, the app has crashed for the fourth time today, right after I hit on a link to go to an article. I hate having to now go back, five hours, to find the page I was on. Something is very wrong with the app. It is happening so frequently, daily, that I am about to give up on using this app for good. Please fix this issue. I can not be the only one experiencing this!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It would be nice to copy and paste things. Also it does crash quite a bit.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I would love the beta version back, the one with the low menu bar.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I love this app, it works easy everytime	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Too much bad language  & too much skin showing. Adults are not the only ones that have FB .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app. Can't wait to see the next round of new features. Sometimes bubbles are annoying and also the app crashed when i scroll through posts that are on pages but its whatever	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Great app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I wish they would make it automatically load the most recent.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Me encanta	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Amazing!!!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Its alright like	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
The app doesn't stay up. It crashes several times. I'm not able to find friends from other states. It would be great if you could put in more information than just a name to search somebody(eg. Birthday, job...).	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
App was working fine then boom update messes it up ugh	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app opens & closes numerous times before being able to use. Can't unfollow conversations, just not as many options as accessing it through safari	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
I am a Facebook addict, basically. I love the app, it's easy& simple to use.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
If you can live with an ever growing intrusion into your personal life & affairs, it's an okay app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
There are a few new features which are nice to have, but this version also became unstable. There were several occasions where I was in the middle of the surfing, and the app crashed on its own. The worst problem is that sometimes the comments posted will "disappear". This is frustrating after typing all those words. This needs to be fixed!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Very good	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
This app is fast not slow like the other app and all my friends used it just needs some work a lil bit	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook has had it's moments, but oh boy it has reached rock bottom with directed adverts and outrageous promotions of date sites and even promoting apps to locate and meet woman for god knows what! And it it won't be tennis.. It's cluttered and far to commercial... If like me you just want to catch up and keep in touch with people then it works.. Watch your privacy settings though.. It's open till you close it...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I can't upload videos anymore, it just blacks out and goes back to the home screen! And when I'm trying to add photos to my albums well, it does the same thing!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Keeps crashing lately.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app worked fine until the last update and since then it will not load anything. iPhone 5.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It's a great app. Love it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Apps pretty good, now if only we could get u to delete stuff off the Facebook servers, ie personal info, msgs, pictures and other data collected and stored over time even when deleted from Facebook by the host of the profile. Save stuff that matters, there's no need to save a picture or message / convo that was deleted by both sides. Archiving is stupid too.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
The app seems to work decently enough, as of late... The site is often the broken link in the chain; but then, that's Facebook. :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
FB does not update. No notifications until after I log in.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Good so far. Does occasionally crash but not to bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

My fb app crashes all the time and I hate not being able to copy satuses	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
How come I can't change my cover in this app that's a fail if u can do it on a iPhone or iPod what's up with that u should make one	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am extremely disappointed that this site has so many girls and guys that advertise porn pictures and other things related. My husband and I both stopped using MySpace due to this problem and now it's moved to here. I see so much more of it now than I did four years ago when I originally signed up. I read all the time that this site won't put up with it, but yet it is on here a lot. I don't want to delete my page because this is the only way I can see how some family and friends are doing due to this is the only place we talk and they live too far to visit. Well thank you for listening and I hope things will be done about it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The upload function for photos on IPAD is horrible! Why on earth are we still having to upload one at a time and why oh why do the groups keep kicking me out right in the middle of me putting one photo up at a time when someone else posts on the group??!?!?!?!?!?!!!! So f ing frustrating! This app for IPAD doesn't show current updates. Doesn't matter if I click on Top Stories or Most Resent. It won't refresh. IT'S SUPER SLLLLLLLOOOOOOOWWWW!!!!!!!!!! Twitchy. CRASHES!!! The last version functioned better on IPAD.Fu Facebook, fu	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Much better	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Won't let me see recently posted even if I keep refreshing. Zooms in on pictures an then when I try to unzoom, the caption is in the way. Slow. New 'chat bubbles' are always in the way.Always crashes, especially when I try to look at a picture.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Needs to show most recent posts first. I can go scroll back and find the old ones on my own. It seems to get worse with each in updates	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
How can one rate something which has changed the social fabric of modern society? Rate Facebook? This is far too complex. Even Margaret & David would struggle.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Why won't you fix this?  Haven't been able to access FB on the iPad for 2 months.  Are you just incompetent or just don't give a rip that your customers can't use the app?  Just wondering.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works but wish it was like the desktop. Hard to delete posts and posting is private not public.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
If something works, don't fix it. By doing this you have rendered the app useless	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Used to be such a good app. Now it crashes all the time, loads items from days ago before recent stories, and the recently added chat popup is super annoying. Would be nice to have the version from a year or so ago... Not nearly as buggy.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very bad version it crashes every two minutes!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I find that it is quite slow loading pages and messages . But all in all s good application	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

I use Facebook often, but what I don't like is the fact it crashes and I have to log back in. Luckily my username and password are stored. Otherwise I'd stop using the app all together and just go on Facebook through my computer.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Last couple of updates have definately added some cool features but my phone is bogged down now. app constantly crashes and I'm just not happy with it anymore, so I've been using twitter a lot more than usual.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I don't know if its the new version causing it to turn off all the time but the timing is suspicious!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's ok could be better	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Acceptable to keep up with FB. Don't like the fact I can't delete messages from FB message options. Some pages I follow have trouble loading pictures & seem to freeze.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
If I could give this zero stars I would! It crashes all the time, it hardly lets me see pictures, and just as fb on your computer, it's ALWAYS changing making things more difficult and stupid.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Wish that this app would stop freezing! I've had to uninstall and reinstall several times on my iPad And my iphone. This is very frustrating !	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Bafore the page was more flexible like widescreen mode. It's difficult to type.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's vaginal	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
There needs to be a capability to edit your status post ... spell check is not always user friendly. Also, why no emoticons within fb 6.2 version for iPads ?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Instead of adding a message bubble that is annoying and unnecessary, how about you fix the crashing and stupid slow load times.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Just like any app and social network it has it's ups and downs. I like it, yes I have issues with it on some occasion. But honestly 8x10 it's working perfectly fine. Nothing is perfect so everything is going to have its issues. It's weather you can get over them to see the bigger picture. All n all I love FB.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Meh it's okay it's getting better. This app seriously used to be the biggest piece of garbage out there. But with the continuous and sometimes (however rarely) useful updates this app has a scrap of hope.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Works really well most of the time. Glad they finally added the ability to share. AA+	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This new app never works. I can't login and when I do, it works for about 5 minutes, then it's right back to not working. It takes forever to load the feed. All around a poor app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Incessant ads in the newsfeed, lack of control over what I see. I only like the part where I am connected to friends & family.And now repeated requests for ratings. I will take this opportunity to gripe about the weird algorithms that dictate which updates I see on a particular device. How about as they are posted, not as different feeds. Oh, and stop the f%*king ads & suggested pages! Aauugh!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update layout is awesome, I'm loving it so much more then the old one. A bit buggy though, not sure of its the app, phone or cellular connection but gone up no Internet service a lot.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

Ahh yes. Another disappointing update full of nothing accomplished. Hands down the worst app I have on my phone. Constantly crashes, photos don't load, and for the love of God please fix the orientation so we can type properly!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Personal I don't like this update. I'm tired of too stories, because they're so irrelevant and please get rid of the spam posts asking for likes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Except for the nagging do you want to rate this app.. I've given my review already, now just stop nagging me.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Thank you for feeding into my Internet addiction	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm sure there are a lot of people out there like me.  I have an iPhone 4S running IOS 5.1.1 and when the App Store told me there was an update available I said, "Hey!  Cool!  Maybe they added some new features..."After I updated the Facebook app, four days or so ago, it crashes EVERY TIME three to four seconds after launching it.I have tried uninstalling then reinstalling [Seven times now] and am having the same problem.  Facebook is one of the largest social networking websites out there and they put up a update that just destroyed the purpose of having the app in the first place.Get your s*** together Facebook and give the people who supported you through all these years and helped you become what you have and give us a working app for our phones!I digress.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still crashes the odd time but overall I really like it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
As I said it crashes sometime and get really slow even on LTE speed.  Needs a lot of improvement even after that many years. Still disappointed.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Yep. Can't post statuses or anything after the last app update on my iPhone 5 Facebook app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a great app if you like ads for products and companies you have no interest in, if you like cats, and of you like apps that constantly pester you to rate them and bug you 5 times a day to turn push notifications on.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It needs to remove the contacts on the message board when you remove them as a friend	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love the FB app! Does what it needs to do!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Since the most recent update, the App no longer works on my iPad3.....it just spins its wheels saying its "updating" but never does.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the app because it gives me access to FB as you would in a regular PC and it works fine but it sometimes crashes and will not show some updates. Other than that it works ok but it is limited by the iphones functionality.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I've really never had any huge problems with FB (apart from another shite update a while back), but since the last update the statuses don't update when opening the app.Sort it out developers! It seems a lot if people have had problems with this latest update.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Would be wonderful! Minus the fact that it crashes constantly..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I used it on my iPad as long as I could.Crashes often and repeatedly, even after closing all apps and re-booting.Many many bugs make it very frustrating to use.What is up with it always opening in portrait mode?  It used to open in whatever orientation I last used, which was always landscape mode on my iPad.  It won't rotate easily to a desired mode either.  It hangs onto portrait even with numerous twists and turns.  Very aggravating!Now it comes back to the News Feed after reading a story and says there is no stories to open.  This is ridiculous.I gave up, it never stays up long enough to do anything.  Went back to the browser version on my PC.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It crashes every time I open the app, but just like everyone else I keep trying until I get in.... Would be nice to get in the first time.... Also would like for my pictures to load faster... Thanks for giving me access to my friends an family.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still has a few kinks to be ironed out but other than that it's all good, finally being able to use feelings in the statuses is awesome as well!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia

ok you guys fixed my last problem and thank you but I have a question now or a statement actually. I think we should be able to unsubscribe from people's status's on the app rather than having to go all the way to the web fb and do it their. thank you =)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

wanting a way to hide all photos from those who are not friends.. like your profile pics and coverphoto..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Before the most recent update, the list of people who liked your post would be in chronological order of when they liked it, with the first liker at the bottom of the list and the most recent liker at the top of the list. Now everyone is in a random order every time the list is opened. I like to open it to see who has liked my status since the last time I was on, and this makes it impossible to sort it out. Please go back to the old way of listing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's extremely convenient, I absolutely  love, never even use my comp anymore, I like this WAY MORE! So get it!! Still feel the same!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

When are they gonna get this app right? Unreal, app is very slow to open after selecting icon. Once open app is not responsive for a long time. Finally, it  allows you to navigate around. Select status, nothing happens for a long time, once the window to put your text in comes up your ready to just close the app and move on. Come on Facebook, get it right. This is getting embarrassing for you all! I am embarrassed for you. Either get it right or pull the app until you do get it right.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

What is wrong with the Newsfeed? It's not consistent. Sometimes it shows the most recent posts. Most of the time it shows whatever it wants. Also, the photo tagging doesn't work. Fix those and I'll give you more stars.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It takes forever and a day for this app to update my news feed, even when I have plenty of service. I also don't like that even when I tap "Most Recent," it doesn't display the most recent activity.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Problems1. Very slow to load timeline.2. I usually opens FB app when a "new message" or "new whatever" badge appears on its icon. I think others would have similar tendency. Then the red "new" counter on either "messages" or "globe" icon should be displayed as such first. I think it should get users' attention. Then it should load the new "whatever" first. However, right after opening it, the red badge is not drawn there, and even though i click one of those buttons, it doesn't list any new. ( if it already put the badge on its home "icon", i guess the program should maintain the data for the new messages already. or it should at least have some info on them.3. Pinned Posts   On Web, pinned posts is not visually apparent. But anyway, it's expanded by default like other posts on a group page, for example.    Then, on this mobile app, it should be the same. However, a user need to click "pinned posts" button to reveal it.  Because it's not so apparent if there was a pinned posts or not, users can think "where is that message I just saw on my PC?"4. Why there is "scroll to more info.." thing on the setting's page? there is no more lines to scroll up! It just waste time!5.  Duplicated posts somehow.    Sometimes, it displays same posts twice.6. many other things..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It's crashing way too much! Even when not multitasking!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update to the Facebook app is great! My only issues are that it sometimes freezes and closes itself for no apparent reason, especially when going through other people's photo albums. Also, sometimes my notification thing (when the app is not open) won't clear itself after I've went through them (ex: It says I have 12 notifications, so I go thru them and they are cleared in the app but once I close the app (sometimes) it says I still have 12 notifications). If these two issues were to be fixed I would rate this 5 stars.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Frequent crashes, pictures taking ages to load, News Feed in complete illogical order - typical Facebook update! Idiots	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The app opens normally, but when I select most recent it shows me stuff from two days ago that I already saw instead of new stuff. Stop screwing around and fix it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I gave this app a 4 because the only real problem I have with it is most of the time when I want to see new status' it takes like a min and a half for it to load but that's about it on my end.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Much faster	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's a good app but it keeps crashing. Please fix it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
What's going? The app is crashing today	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This stupid app is so slow it's practically unusable. It crashes constantly; doesn't go into landscape mode; makes many of my posts disappear into thin air when I touch "post", after painstakingly typing a long post...I hate this app. I now view FB with Google Chrome for iPhone, which is fast and isn't bogged down with useless features and DOES go into landscape. Don't waste your time with this app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love to use Facebook. But sometime even when we are still using, Facebook is close by himself, pls better fix this problem for us..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes after 10 seconds of being in the app!!! I love facebook and all BUT IT ALWAYS CRASHES AND FREEZES!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Force closes WAAAAY TOO MUCH!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Every time I check a notification, it asks me if I want to receive similar notifications on my phone. There is no way to turn off this prompt, and it's driving me crazy!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I'm not sure what anyone else is having problems with but I am still amazed and thrilled to be able to see friends and family that are far away and get to share drops in the buckets of their lives.  This is an app, a tool, and is not a trade for a real life.  In the iPad version, this update I cannot change my background photo but I can on my pc and phone so I'll live.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I cannot edit photo caption or customize privacy settings of particular stuff, like photo albums. I hope it's gonna be possible in the future.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Yeah I'm addicted to Facebook and it craved every 10 seconds its almost not worth having.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
FB doesn't fuss with the app as much as they do the website. I only use the app now and if it weren't for the app I'd still have my account deactivated. FB, don't fuss with this too much or I'll leave again. Keep it simple please.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Used to be fairly a stable app but lately it crashes 2-3 times per minute. What's going on here?!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Facebook is really good. I can keep up with friends and family all the time. Thanks	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's great...stop asking me rate it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
How is it possible that this problem with this app update has not been resolved. I am moving closer to just ending my Facebook account.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pero por favor pÌ_ngale el botÌ_n de compartir las publicaciones de los demÌÁs tambiÌ©n	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app stinks. Incomplete, iffy and intermittent. Facebook, this is sloppy work.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Lov it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
I like everything about Facebook, except the Timeline feature. With the Timeline, I can never find any of my past statuses or notes. Everything gets lost with Timeline ... Or maybe it's because I don't know how to use it effectively.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
App closes all on its own and is aggravating!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Runs great.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like this app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Plz take out blocking ppl on fb	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Thanks for the changes!  Great easy access to groups and pages!  Easy to upload photos and videos now thank you	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's ok. It's been crashing a lot lately. Please fix this and get it together.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes every once in a while... Fix that please and thank you.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Ok	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I use this app alot as i have no desktop, i agree with alot of the previous reviews about "posts from others" and other things like that, what i would most like to see is improvements such as tagging possibly photos and maybe even feelings on the status bar for IOS in the Notification slider	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Not user friendly...crashes and hard to search for friends....post appear then disappear...then appear. However it'sy only communication to family from all over the place!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I, admittedly, spend a ton of time in Facebook! Not only does it allow me to share my family's life with friends and family, especially those far away, but it also allows me the opportunity to look back and remember...remember all the great times I've spend with my husband, children, family, and friends. It allows me to relive memories and really capture them in true time as well as pin point specific dates, times, and events. Having the app mobile means I'll never miss an accomplishment of my children, a memory with my husband, a night out with a friend, or a family BBQ...I'll always be able to look back; years from now (as long as FB stays alive, which better be a long time) and almost be able to relive my life (at least from the time I joined FB), almost day by day, year by year, and post by post. Most of all it will allow my children to timeline their life, it will allow my children, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, and so on to relive our family's life. Memories won't fade, pictures won't be lost, and our history will be documents and easily accessed. Thanks FB!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Every time I click on a friends page or picture it crashes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's wonderful!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Way too many changes.  Makes the mobile system very glitchy and slow.  Always moving or deleting things that I use regularly.  Seems to ask too many questions of a personal nature that I do not want on the web.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Needs a few more features the desktop site offers though, but getting very close.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Wish you would fix the app it's force closing on my iPhone 5, 4s and iPad. The app force closes since the last update please fix asap	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Worst mobile app I've used.  15-30 second pauses for no reason.  Crashes a lot.  FB should be ashamed of itself for writing the lowest quality mobile app in existence.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Most recent doesn't work and has posts from 3 hours ago in between posts from 20 mins ago	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Nice app. No problems. Yet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook iOS devs can't seem to get it together. Can't pan and zoom images properly. Crashes constantly.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I mainly use this app to coordinate events for a wide range of reasons. Unfortunately the app won't let me do anything of the sort! What is the point d the app integrating with my phone and calendar if they won't let you update or change event details??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Constantly crashes. Extremely slow. Messages will not load. Worthless app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps crashing!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
this app is so, so, so frustrating! its gotten worse and worse with every update! stop focusing on adding stickers and stupid things like that and start focusing on actually making it open and stop crashing. terrible. just simply terrible.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
The features are getting better but it'd b better if you could see friends birthdays easier!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It's pretty sad that with this most recent "update" (if you can call it that), is still 'littered' with bugs- if you will. You're gonna have to step it up, dudes, if you want happier customers. It's gotten to the point, that I'm tempted to remove the app, and just access FB with the Internet app, instead. Step. It. Up.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The facebook app works really good, i love it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can not believe that Facebook people are not able to make a decent App for iPhone. This App is not reliable. It takes ages to load so you loose interest. It is challenging me to stop using it. Please fix it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Great!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Worse app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My app keeps quitting on me. It's annoying. Also, when im messaging people, when it says they saw it the thing says "Seen Sunday at 8:32AM" and it won't change.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it. Works great.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The only reason I use this piece of Crap is I haven't found something better.  I can't give it zero stars	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
When i start to scroll down it will take me to the top or it will open up some stupid page. It shows an add every 2nd to 3rd post, i try to open up a post and it opens an add, wont let me send messages to group pages (i.e. radio stations) even though they promote sending messages to them. Regular crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Fcmmjajaayejks	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
still crashes every now and then but overall okay app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Needs to be able to landscape view	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great way to keep in touch with friends	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
So far, I haven't had many issues. The older version blacked out a lot, but the update is much better!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The fact that I can't access my others folder from my mobile is so frustrating! Oh and also that I can't delete my wall posts from mobile	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I'm not loving FB or its lousy interface. With all the money this place makes you'd think they could do better.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
All this app does is crash. I try and view a page, CRASH. I go and hit the "see more" button, CRASH. I want to view a picture, CRASH. I'm getting really tired of this app right now and all it's crashing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app on my 4s deserved 4 stars before the last update. Afterwards? Not so much. It's takes forever to load, and if by some miracle it does load, then I can't view pictures. I've been using the mobile site instead of the app. Sorry to say this, but this Facebook app is really not worth my time because it's such a pain in my rear.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Don't always like the changes but it's a great way to stay in touch with old friends and kin.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
No problems.... So far anyway	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It crashes every minute. The worst app i have ever seen. I don't know what was wrong with older version. This one is a real headache !	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good app just wish you could unfollow a post on the app and not just the desktop site...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I see all the bad reviews, but I don't have any of those problems! I really enjoy this program.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes after the new update even tho it says its gonna fix the bug when your about to update and you check for details,I would like to have that fix ASAP for all user and so on..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I want to be able to view my newsfeed how i want!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Glitches constantly. But it's better than no facebook. After the new update it constantly crashes. Fix it for the iPhone 5.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
People can complain about this app all they want, but I dare them to switch to just about any other kind of phone's version of the app for about a month or so and see how they feel then. Yes, it has glitches occasionally. Yes, it drives me crazy sometimes. No, it isn't perfect. ...welcome to technology.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Lags a bit but in general great app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
There is something going on with putting pics from my iPhone storage onto FB.  It's stretching them on the normal computer and making them tiny when looking at them on my phone.  I end up having to delete then because they look awful.  Please please fix this!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So ever since the update you guys took out the index alphabets on the right side of the friends list. Now you have a big search bar on the top. Not cool or user friendly. I have many friends that I can't remember everyone's name. Please put that index on the right where I can just tap on the alphabet to see all my friends with their first alphabet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great app. No problems at all.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook is yet to make me real true friends to value!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
srsly something is wrong with this app like I have to re-open the app again and re-open it again :/ plz fix it.. :'(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Okay app occasionally crashes but gets the job done	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Worst than ever, you could imagine it won't get worse but somehow they mange to make it! Worst app ever!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love this works great on iPhone	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I Love it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It works very well, sometimes it has a few glitches. It is a good app other wise	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Freezes & Shuts down. It shuts down every time I try to get into my Photo Album. Very Annoying. FIX ASAP.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I can't even go to photos without the app crashing, please do something about this please?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It ok	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I agree with person who says "crashbook" I'm never in this app more than 5 mins at a time if I'm that lucky and sure cant message anyone because messages won't show up in bubble chat but shows there is new messages	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My only complaint is, I would like to be able to turn my IPhone sideways again to use FB.... Bring Landscape mode back for the entire FB not just photos!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I had just finished updating my app when all of a sudden, poof! It disappeared. Now normally I would just re-install it, however it won't let me, it only says [open]. Looks like I'm stuck with no app...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This app may not be THE reason for living ;-) but it sure makes living so much more fun when you can share it with those you care about. This app makes sharing a breeze and it just keeps getting better and better.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love this app 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I wish it wouldn't crash so much! It's gotten better with the updates. But I hope they fix it better	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I was surprised when it let me upload my profile pic !! Good job facebook :))	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Crashes everyday, throughout the day.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook used to work fine, now it takes like 3 times of trying to open it before it will actually stay opened, once it's open it works fairly decent though. It just gets annoying at times!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The facebook app is buggy. Cannot comment and have to keep logging into facebook using safari. Come on fix it and stop making stupid changes. RESPECT OUR PRIVACY! RESPECT MY AUTHORITY!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

With each update / upgrade the mobile apps (iPhone and iPad) there are more & more crashes and a few glitches. NOW the current date & time on my iPad no longer appear at top of screen. FB still periodically shuts down for no apparent reason. Come on, folks, get it together!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
FACE BOOK IS AWSOME I LOVE IT =)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It works.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Apparently other people have problems with it crashing, but it's reliable for me!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
App is choppy when scrolling and notifications don't show till you manually refresh them. Update seems to have caused this	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Rubbish new update now won't load just keep seeing timer !! Sort this out this is a major app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Its okayyy	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

MUCH BETTER...BUT... Keep it stable.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's eeehh  not great but not horrible only major problem is that it won't stay on the "most recent" I have to keep changing it to it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's good but sometimes it crashes!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Yeah it's ok I guess....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
It slow and I want the old version back.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's a really nice app but I dislike the new bubble chat style where the person you're IMing is like a little bubble floating around on your screen and it doesn't seem to refresh very well.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Please fix this app.. I can barely look at a picture without it freezing or having to reopen it! It crashes way too often	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate the new update, crashes all the time, fix Plz!? Once again it has frozen, Plz fix. Why can't you fix it?? Freezes everyday!!!! Plz,Plz ,Plz, fix!!!! It keeps crashing when I'm looking at my pix Plz help!,! It crashed. Again Plz help!! Not working!!  Much, much, much better since the update!! My app has frozen, Plz help!! Ok the update is horrible. Keeps shutting off!! Plz fix June 21rst keeps shutting off, Plz fix keeps crashing! Horrible!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app works flawlessly	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Before the update it ran really smooth but after every time I slide the update bar on my home feed it freezes and I can't do anything while it tries to figure whatever out and I'm not one to write reviews but its was getting unbearable plz fix	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Can we please get functionality to copy text from posts within the app. Also, it would be great to be able to edit previous posts.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Another update and still no sound notifications.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
When I upload a picture and have all of my tags and captions (+ how I'm feeling) it never shows up after its uploaded. Just the picture, no captions, tags, or feelings. Please fix this. It gets really annoying when you have to go back and edit the caption on the safari version.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Much better!!!!! But really STOP deleting pages!!! This is America everyone has a right to express them selves!!! Delete pages for animal cruelty or child porn, NOT BDSM or the military, the very people who make it possible for you to have a job Facebook!!!! Just stop being an up tight church lady who thinks they know what's best for the world!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Continues to shutdown randomly and doesn't load properly.User friendly but would like to use the status tags.Also I would like to create events easier and to see all updates from friends.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Worst. App. Ever.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app. Love it x would be lost without it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It I must say anything and that would be IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN BEFORE... I like my old foto and the possibility to turn my screen but on the flip side It really has improved and it's really cool now!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Add this feature on the facebook iphone app pleaseeeee( Comment with Photo )	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Seriously if there were something else where my connections were, I'd be there instead. The platform for iPhones crashes multiple times a day. There is no way that I can find on the mobile or full version to block spammers in my messages. Not to mention FB now spams your news feed with stuff you have to hide, but if its liked by some one you know you can't hide it or report it as spam. So it's a sacrifice between crashing and privacy issues and access to where all my pertinent social contacts are. And by the time the fixes for the multiple daily crashes occur, the app is updated and brings more bugs that crash the app...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Lets me stay in contact with my family. Love it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Keeps shutting down have uninstalled and reinstalled that many times now, it works fine for a week then every time u read a message or comment on a statuses it goes back to the home screen on my phone and iPad, I'd give it no stars but wouldn't let me only been happening since last 3 updates	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Wouldn't update the newsfeed and notifications since the last update. My iPhone works fantastically fast with everything else except for this app, idk why :(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Nothing's perfect. There will always be improvements that people may or may not like. It's Facebook though and I think it will always be the place to 'be'.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
It's even hard to post review	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great way to keep in touch with family and friends! Very grateful for the ability to stay "in touch" with so many people that I has lost contact with years ago! Thanks FB !!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love the FB app, but it only needs 2 more features; Hashtag support and Landscape mode!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It is a black hole devouring moments of my day that I will never get back.  As the years go by the time wasted accumulates, life wasted, not lived in real time, but sadly experienced vicariously.  It's a tragedy our society endures.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I like it FB	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I don't like this version. Don't like all the adds and the constant repeat of older posts from weeks ago.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Pros-Being able to share posts to your page rather than just your timeline.-Like the feeling setting in post a status.Cons-Keeps reverting back to top stories when you refresh news feed rather than most recent stories.-Don't like the fact that when you send someone a message their photo stays up on the side of the screen. I know you can just drag and remove it but it's just annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
-Unable to view comments in "photos of you" -Great that you made it easier to delete comments by holding down the comment you want to delete. -Easier to change audience of posts after posting. -Landscape option would be great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is really good to use but it crahes everytme I open it!!!Pls fix it!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I wanna update my cover better like my profile pic. 'Crash crash crash some more. Oh look your hitting your head on the wall that's nice lets crash once more to make sure you truly feel that way about me crashing.' That's what Facebook says	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Absolutely Fab x	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Do not open this update, cannot load now.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Can't do so many things on the desktop version.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is a great place to find friends or make new ones its all up to you that's the great thing about it it's all about what you want to be on there	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Please add feature to edit caption on pictures!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Please go back to the old Facebook features...:/	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love the Facebook app but it always crashes when I go onto someone else's profile. If I'm looking at their pictures I can click on one photo and then 5 seconds later it'll just crash and take me to my home screen and it happens every single time. I'd love if you could fix this problem!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
I always have to open & reopen this app cause it keeps getting out. It's SUPER annoying . Fix this.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It has its flaws... But to me still the best way to stay connected to my friends abroad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It's Facebook foo	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
New update awful.  Keeps crashing please please fix	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I want to change my cover photo from the app. You've managed to fix all my other problems so I'm liking this.. I need this.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Awesome it's really speedy the updated Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love the app but the constant changes kind of get old and some changes are difficult or not explained well enough or/if not at all or make things harder...just depends and once you get used to one way, you have to start all over again and start a diff way....but other then that ramble I'm  pleased so far!! :))	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
it gets me mad how I have to open it twice to actually use it, & when I actually do use it, it only lasts 30 seconds until it crashes & I have to repeat the whole process.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Horrible tired if this crazy closing for no reason and so dam slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is good . I am addicted to it though. :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
I use it often and find it easy to use; to catch-up with my friends etc. However, this Apps' only 'downside' is that you can't get a larger keyboard, you know like on iPhones on just simple messages, you turn the device Landscape, and it turns with you, therefore a larger and easier-to-use keyboard. But not on this. Please improve this in the next update; I think a lot more people would like that too...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Also, there are a lot of functions that can't be done from this app. Please improve the app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great for keeping in touch, but slow and very clunky with pictures.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Best social app ever	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
it's good for me . thank you	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Not letting me customize my viewers on my posts !!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
You can add all the bells and whistles you want but I still think its stupid that this app won't rotate to landscape for optimal texting. Plus, the additional crashes and pic freezing ain't helpin either.*update* Still adding features that make the app crash. Still doesn't support landscape unless it a pic/video.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Freezes once in a while but it's ok I guess	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I don't like how it says to continue with this or not you. I don't want it like that no more	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I think this is a great app, obviously not got as much as full computer programme, but hey this is a phone!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Terrible do not get it ! Closes all the time rubbish	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
best page ever	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It is getting crappier!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Its all good, just get annoyed that when i post something, sometimes it does it two or three times in a row!??! Good app though.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Horrible.!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Most used app on my phone	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Creo que este "update" es de los mÌÁs significativos, de hecho borrÌ© el "facebook messege" ya no es necesario. Muy bueno y estable, se pueden tener 4 conversaciones simultanias al mismo tiempo. PERO HACE POCO SE "crashes" CRACHEA TODO EL TIEMPO.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Y'all have really outdone yourselves I have not 1 complaint about this app! Please keep wowing us with the updates.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love Facebook on iPhone. Helps you keep in contact with friends you would otherwise never hear from again.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Loving the updates	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Not working at all now. Useless.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Worst Social Media ever made! The fact that things my friends like shows up on my wall and gives me videos that they like on my feed that are either disgusting or very inappropriate, gives out to much information for people to find you off of other peoples accounts just because you liked a post it shows to everyone and TOO MANY ADDS!!! on the mobile version	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is fine but the only problem is that sometimes it doesn't upload pictures for you.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Just wish we had all the desktop options on this app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Hey! Jew scum! How about fixing disappearing status updates that don't post! Hitler was right for thinning you out. Shame he got interrupted before he finished wiping you of the planet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Brilliant!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Fab in most counts my only gripe is that I can't tag my business page in comments or statuses and I hate that I have to change it to most recent on the newsfeed it doesn't stay in it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
The feelings thing is a cool novelty, but I'd much rather my "most recent" news feed have the most recent posts... Not bits and pieces from the last 48 hours... Fb had the news feed right in the early days-as my fave song goes "don't break what don't need fixing"!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Can't believe it keeps getting worse with each update...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Often freezes.App at times unusable, due to refreshing so slowly. Even though connected to a high speed wifi network.Infuriating at times!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Keeps crashing now and then for some unknown reason  please sort it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Just love using it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Best app ever just wish it had faster speeds and less congestion!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Theres nothing to put your news feed into time order. They are all mixed up. Its annoying	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I love Facebook :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I love facebook. It helps me a lot. Idk why i needed it but i love it anyway :3	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I never use FB on my computer so it's good to know most features are now on the mobile version. Keep updating and improving!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Its ok, nowhere near the same as the full facebook but not bad,could do without the constant game adds though	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It's a great app just you can't copy a link or paste but its great really	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
A great way to socialize and non-stop laughs...I really enjoy my time on here with YOU :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's like twitter but no celebs	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Updated the app and it has been crashing all the time. Now all of a sudden it does not let me log in. Dissatisfied	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I think the update made it slow needs faster loading and more things to do	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Why add things if you have problems preventing to use them? App crashes every time to where you have to close the app and restart it only for it to do it again minutes after.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love Facebook but how the pictures show now is pretty crap! Cut the sides of and zoomed in if the pictures where as the where put on then it would be the best!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Slow! Keeps shutting down! Awful app!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This app is so frustrating, most recent status is not most recent it's a mix up of times and dates. You cannot look and search new pages to like.Crashes and you can't tag people in pictures. Terrible.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Its amazing nothing wrong with it :D	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
No bad few problems get fixed quite quick with updates quick and easy you use am	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Hoping the suit it to iOS 7! I'm getting sick of the design. It needs to be easier to use. And really don't see the point in having messenger? All it does is gives me 2 notifications. Silly	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Still crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app needs modernising and making more user friendly! X	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Except for the ads and not really having relevant friends in the newsfeed and while liking being able to post photos on s comment- wwweeeeellll how about no ads, friend newsfeed selection tool, and being able to enlarge and save the photo. Oh and I'd like to be able to see where and who the photo came from in the first place. I find it annoying that the author often gets lost	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love this app it's simple and easy to use.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I wouldn't bother with Facebook unless you want to know what your friends had for breakfast or the progress of their in growing toe nails.If you 'like' pictures  of a children with Down Syndrome, this is the perfect APP for you. You need not do anything more than tap a button then relax knowing you have shown your acceptance.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The app is okay but i only want 'most recent' stories in my newsfeed and when i select that option , it never seems to work.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia

No complaints. Keep it up!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love that I can be connected to Family and Friends even when away from the computer!  The ads leave something to be desired, if I want to look at other things I can search all by myself	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can I go back to previous version? Since updating I am unable to access my Facebook on my phone at all! Extremely frustrating, if it ain't broke don't try to fix it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Does what it needs to do, maybe could be a bit quicker but either than that its fantastic.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Like i said it does wot it says in the name  !!!! But it asks to many questions. Thanks to FB I find my brother after 10yrs.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

This app likes to crash a lot. Especially when I'm in the middle of writing a long message. And the little bubble icons are annoying..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Essential !. It's mint	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I have tried to be patient but frankly nothing has changed! You would think a multi BILLION dollar company would try harder. Shame on you Facebook. Shame.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
FB is the most annoying app on my iphone. FB team has really screwed up...The FB bubble chat is the worst design and is very slow while sending chat messages..... FB iOS team are you really testing the app performance before releasing to AppStore ??Apple should also create a category called Hall of Shame for these kind of apps.Please get me the old facebook app...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great to be in contact with people far away and close by so easily.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Love it. Makes staying in touch with family easy. Other than the drama that comes with it it's a good thing	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Regular pointless updates and changes to layout and functions!Regularly freezes, crashes and kicks you out of the app!Doesn't show all status updates of friends and groups!!When are you going to get it sorted??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Always shows updates from days ago, should be 'most recent' by default... Always cuts the edges off pictures... Can't see 'others' inbox so have to use a pc to see them.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Facebook is awsome and I love it 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
I like	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
or, the option to do so. only google maps shows me bus routes connected to train routes, and times. i don't want to use apple maps. it is near impossible to get the address after it is auto-sent to maps. i have no idea how.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Keeps on freezing. Annoying	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
Can u put the cover photo feature in the new update please	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	New Zealand
This is stupid! I'm giving this app a rating because it won't stop asking! It's Facebook anyone who hasn't heard of it in this modern age obviously lives under a rock! The app is what it is, there's no alternative so even if it sucked you still have to use it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Still the best for me, the only reason I give it 3 stars is because if someone dislikes you and has a grudge against you it's easy for them to get you banned for 12 hrs without Facebook getting your side of the story... Sometimes the text getting typed, doesn't keep up with the speed you're typing at. Overall tho, still the best social networking app! Really like the messenger floating bubble! Big success!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
When you try to view a picture or get a better view at it by zooming in or clicking it, it FREEZES and I have to exit and close the app so fix it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have restarted and logged in and out, and nothing has worked!! I cannot get my news feed to load since downloading the update! I finally had to start using the web version. Completely frustrated!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok I don't understand this app...I've never had any problems with it at all but I always check to see what is updating....and I always see big fixes....and I'm like "ok I never get those but it should help If I do" well I have to literally reinstall the app at least 15 times a week so that it'll work and I hope this next update fixes it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Really good app, fast moving and easy to use :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Can't take anymore of the constant crashes, finally i deleted it.  No pleasure at all in using this app, just frustration and annoyance. I am on an ipad 1 which tends to crash some apps anyway, but this app is the absolute worst. Every single time i use it it will crash at least once just on start.. Then when it works for abit and crashes again (which it does relentlessly without fail when i am trying to read anything) then when i reopen it it never remembers where i was. Also it never ever remembers i use my ipad in landscape mode. Why??? But whatever, i don't care anymore, its gone.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Totally confusing the share feature is never the same I can't figure out how to use it one time it shares with the person I want and another time it wants to send message or some other post   Don't like it at all. I sometimes just want to share something special with one person.  I was able to do that at one time now who knows what you will get.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why is there no landscape mode?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's getting better with all these different gadgets we can use, but at the same time out of no where sometimes ill be on my page scrolling and it exits! Also sometimes when I click on photos on others people pages its freezes and they don't even have alot of pics to view. Other than that ill give Facebook a 4* since there is more to do on here.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Essential app to have for chatting and sharing random ****.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
just keeps gettin better and better!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I am hoping that if I review this app, Facebook will stop asking. Yes, it works big whoop!June...Yes, once again Facebook is asking me to review this app....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Just found why my iPhone battery goes flat so quick - this app NEVER SLEEPS!!! WHY would I want to repeatedly read yesterday's news, while the new news gets buried down the list?  Most Recent needs to be default.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Horrible in about everything I keep uninstall and reinstall it pfff	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Some things are difficult or impossible to do from the app; that needs worked on.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
When am I going to b able to use the fb app and have the screen rotate when I turn the phone sideways??!! This is my only complaint, other than that the app is awesome!! 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

They keep removing options! Why?!?First they removed Landscape mode and now you can no longer view "RECENT POSTS BY OTHERS" on group pages!! Again, WHY???!Terrible experience for iPod Touch owners. This was so much better about 5 versions ago!! 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I have taken a cue from a friend and transformed my use of the mobile version to photo blog and networking with other artists.  Brilliant.  Works beautifully on my iPhone 5.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
U can't click on other on this app if so how ?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Loved my fb app untill this update everything is so different!! Change it back!!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I'm getting so tired of Facebook crashing and throwing me out of the app. I swear it always happens when I'm trying to type in a message to someone - sometimes long, important messages - or trying to read something. Completely inconvenient because I'll have to start all over. Facebook used to be amazing but now (so it feels) you developers are just having fun adding complete useless crap and watching us complain without even bothering to answer our opinions or complaints. I greatly assume you are under a mountainous pile of stress but please, dear goodness, the app RELIES on your customers, listen for just a moment!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app worked wonders, and now it seems to have gone under. Crashes constantly, along with the Facebook messenger app. Can't I use Facebook in peace without it crashing constantly?? I hate to resort to using my web browser. Must fix this issue	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
It's all good to me hahaha this app I use it all the time . :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Gr8 for keepin in touch with friends :))	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I used to like using this Facebook app, but as of recent updates/versions, all it does it keep crashing time and time again, even after updates that apparently fixed bugs/crashing... hmm I don't think you did a very good job of 'fixing' anything really!!This app crashes for me more and more frequently, even if I'm just on the messages talking to my girlfriend, where if I lock the screen between getting messages from her and replying back, there's a good chance that upon unlocking my device (iPod Touch 4th Gen), then the Facebook app will crash and I'll be back on the main home screens with all the apps! Even when I'm replying the app will crash for no reason frequently and sometimes results in not only having to re-type my reply, but also for some reason the text typing area/box would have a previous reply in it instead of just being blank, even though that message reply of mine was from hours ago, and it keeps coming back when (not if) the app crashes again!I've just removed the app from my iPod and I'm away to install it back in to see if that helps with the problem at all, which I doubt it will, but I thought I would leave an app review first, to let you guys know how annoyed I am with what this Facebook 'app' has become!It's about as bad as the Twitter app changing its layout and adding useless new features, of which I decided to stick with an older version of the app where it works fine and everything was much better too! I wish I had done this with Facebook as well, and kept a version of the app where crashes weren't as frequent as getting messages on Facebook itself!I hope you, the app developers or bug/crash fixing team, have taken the time to read not only my review, but also the reviews left by others who are disappointed and annoyed by this app!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Runs sooo freakin slow & crashes while I'm trying to use it smh this should've been fixed with all these updates y'all have been doing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a fine app but it crashes all the time when at alot of photos and when u try to delete and edit your own. The need to put landscape back on so I can turn and leave comments easier.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
La app antes funcionaba mejor, al enviar imagenes o publicar imagenes se cierra, todo esto desde un iphone 4, espero que lo arreglen pronto.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I jus hate how now every time I wanna share a post that after it loads it takes me waaaaaay back to the beginning of either my recent activity feed or news feed. That's annoying especially when I've been scrolling through for a while. Other than that, great.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I would give the Facebook app a 5-star rating , except it constantly crashes , sometimes takes a while to update my feed , posts a status twice , and it freezes . Please fix these bugs ??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Cannot load updates, I have to reboot phone to get updates. Frustrated!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After a week of dealing with all the crashes and restarting the app for it to just go crash again, I was hoping for an update to fix it! But noooo! Here I am having to seek other means to get on Facebook. Whoever is behind this is showing a great talent at being INCOMPETENT! Get someone to do the job right!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Shuts down on me so often. Doesn't always let me refresh. Gets annoying	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
On the iPhone- and sometimes the iPad- this app just routinely crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good application , it does have a habit  of crashing every so often which can be annoying ...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I hate the new update. Its always crashing. Its becoming more slower. How many bad reviews do you need to realize you should fix these problems?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This works perfectly with my iPhone 5. Better than any other app I've tried for a smart phone. No probs what so ever. Recommended download	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Great app! Constant upgrades! Love the new on screen chat without leaving your page! A++++++ in my book! But what do I know I'm just a user lol good job FB	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's gotten a lot better. Keep up the good work 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is worse than going to fb.com in safari. You cannot delete a post just made from the app or hide the post from your timeline, but safari lets you do it. Way to make a mobile web page better than the actual app...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very entertaining social network.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Every time I open this app is shows loading and nothing ever loads. I have to turn my phone completely off to get it to stop sitting there stuck and running. Very frustrating!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Kind of slow and super glitchy. I get thrown out every day that I'm in it. Videos and photos hang. At times I've been frozen out (crashes upon entry repeatedly or never opens up) and had to go through mobile sign-on which works better than the app!! Also had to delete and reload the app to get around the crash issue. This app is a waste of time and memory space!!! The stickers are fun though for chats.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app crashes and freezes constantly. It gets worse with every update. It changed my choice from 'newest' to their desired highlighted 'newsfeed' no matter how many times I pick the way I want MY newsfeed to be.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every update makes the app that much better!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Like the new update	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I constantly have to delete and reinstall the app each and every time I want to use it! It's always "thinking" and never updates. I also hate that every single time I log in I have to change my preference to most recent. If i set it to most recent it should stay that way until I change it. Very frustrating!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love Facebook, but I can't STAND Facebook mobile.  I have an iPhone, and I use the Facebook mobile app constantly throughout every day.  My biggest complaint is that it takes what seems like FOREVER for the app to refresh the data (update Notifications, show pictures in my NewsFeed, etc.).  I do realize that "things" are technically MUCH faster now than what they were just a few short years ago.  However, we as a society have become so used to those technological advances that we now come to expect it...and we notice right away when something (such as this app) falls short.  Sorry, but we want our data...and we want it now. Perhaps we're spoiled, but that is the reality, and I think that the people who are responsible for the maintenance and updates to this app should make this a top priority.  It doesn't matter how many cool gizmos and gadgets you add to the app if the app, generally speaking, is kind of a pain to use.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Crashes a lot and slow to load.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Yes, once every few days it may crash  but for the amount of  ‰ã_spend on this app, it is definitely notch! It only takes the  blink of an eye to reopen. To the whiners, if you don't like it don't use it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love the update, great design, great look, but... It tends to crash a lot more for some reason... Please fix. Thanks:))	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Constant crashing, organising the news feed doesn't work, it's a generally average app, quite unimpressed. Not able to edit your posts either	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Suchsssss	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Dope!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Not sure what happened to this app but  it is slow, unresponsive and viewing posted pics is an absolute chore. The freezes every time you attempt to view comments on a pic to the point you need to shut the app down.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Newest iPad, iPhone 4 crashes are beyond irritating. Up to date on software. Have to open it a couple times. Please fix the bugs. I will say better than the update 3-4 updates ago when I couldn't open or load Facebook at all. Getting better, but not there yet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app, or more actually the whole entire Facebook website is failing me. I'm disappointed. I need Facebook to connect with my far away family but I might need a new way instead. My wall is posting spam posts, without my permission! And when I tried to log out after I reset my password to try and fix the problem and it crashes! I'm very disappointed and hope you can fix the problem or ill be forced to deactivate my account.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The wee chatheads are cool but the app keeps crashing and is really slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Much better now. Has almost everything the desktop version has, but still crashes somewhat often.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
IM SERIOUSLY TIRED OF THIS' EVERY TIME I GET ON FB IT CRASHES EVERY TWO SECONDS! IT WONT LET ME UPLOAD PICTURES !!! AND ITS SLOW!!! YOU BETTER FIX THIS NOW!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App crashes all the time. Often wont open at all. Clicking on things takes forever to open, if ever. I used to like this app!  Get rid of the stupid floating faces and fix this app!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good apps works fine on my iphone	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Every update makes the app worse and harder to live with Firstly flicking through pictures is a pain because the slightest movement up it down. Sends you back to your news Feed.     And the app crashes every     5minutes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I don't see why it's that bad. You people are impatient and need to wait and it'll work better?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Ever since I applied the most recent update a few days ago, FB is barely usable!!!I cannot load any photos, create albums, or even sometimes view friend's albums, not to mention the very frequent crashes - MAJOR FIX NEEDED PLEASE!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This app crashes every time I open it. When I can get it to stay open it is slow, but I love the interface. Please fix this.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Don't update to the new version! It doesn't load or update, and if you want to read posts in newsfeed, all it keeps doing is scrolling back to the top post?...Very poor!Updates=trouble!If I could give it no stars I would!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Just uploaded 50 pics into my mobile uploads, but now none of them are showing!! Only 5 are showing on my wall, but people are liking them so they are obviously there somewhere!! I try to tag myself in the ones people are liking but they aren't coming up on my 'pics of me' pleaseeee help!!! Driving me mental.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I could write what everyone else is writing about: crashes, landscape mode, slower-than-slow, etc. but they're all saying it. Fix those things. Quit coming up with stupid things, like the huge smiley heads in chat. What are we? Nine years old?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great changes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Depends on the version you have as it alternately is good or terrible. Meh.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Wonderful	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I wish they would update this app for iPhone because I have certain friends that don't even show as friends on my friend list nor can I tag them anything because it makes you think you're not friends. Also, they need to update to make changing profile pics etc easier. This app needs a lot of changes!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not updating. Just little spinney thing and nothing happens. What a disappointment.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The only complaint that I have is that the Facebook icon on my phone always shows double the notifications that I actually have. So, for example, over the Facebook icon, there would be a red 4 over it, I'd get excited and open the app to find that I have only 1 or 2 notifications. Forever alone. Other than that, it's Facebook; It's a decent app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I enjoy Facebooking on my phone. I do it often. Lately it has been freezing and taking long periods of time to load photos or open pages. I close the app and turn off my phone restart everything and it still will take forever to load pictures. Even when I have Wifi.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Fix the bugs! App crashes a lot. I gave two stars because I like the design and chat features. Add the chance to send video messages! If you fix it I will rate 5 stars	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great social networking website. The app is great and does everything you want or need to enjoy the site.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Awful app for what you'd expect from the most popular social media outlet in the world. Just bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I love Facebook but I'd love to be able to put multiple accounts on the app. I have two due to my business as well as my personal. So I have to put one in safari and it's just frustrating.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love Mark Zuckerburg but I have a problem with censorship!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It is what it is.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I try to post something and it tells me it's been flagged as inappropriate or spammy. I can't post anything I stay at one star til it's fixed. This is ridiculous.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why did Facebook do that  ???Previous app worked so fine, done the update, can't load newsfeed properly.Please sort that out or allow me to download old version. !!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It's good! It's great! Now stop asking me to rate!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Stability seems to have vanished, crashing and freezing more in the past week than it has ever done before. 3 times just in the past 2 hours.Also not sure why there isn't the same share functionality on the app as a desktop to share to specific groups or individual timelines...Despite two more updates since writing the above, stability is still questionable, still cannot specify timelines to share posts or photos to, so much missing compared to the desktop version, including copying links etc so I can share them.....still needs a lot of work.I keep having to resort to Safari to get the functionality I expect..surely with all the billions of å£/$ generated, FB could actually get some talent to make an app that's actually works properly!?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Constantly crashes . I end up going on Facebook on Safari or my computer .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I'm sure you know this app has had problems for years with crashing, loading slow, freezing, and not running like it should.  Maybe Facebook should look into getting professional app developers and dump the ones they currently have?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works good, havent had it crash on me, of course I dont spend 6 hours a day on fb talking to friends i never met.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Use this app more than anything...but will crash over and over; usually when initially opening the app and when looking through pictures. Definitely needs to be fixed...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The only problem I have with it is that sometimes it freezes for like 5 seconds when pulling up a picture but it gets faster with every update. It's easy to use and convenient.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Slow. Slow. Slow. Hate it, really. I usually won't update anything but thought, why not? BAD IDEA! I will never get use to this version. Actually deleted it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Get rid of suggested apps in my newsfeed. Advertisements on sidebar are enough. Too slow loading and updating. Too slow uploading notifications.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Overall, not a bad little program, but it can be glitchy sometimes, closing suddenly, and needs to have improved controls for managing friends, blocking people and apps, etc. My single biggest grievance is that I can't edit status updates, comments, etc. I have to go in on my computer to do that, which isn't always an option right after I make a mistake, such as when my phone's autocorrect changes my words on me.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Facebook is messed up won't load !!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Not to bad... Kinda clunky and weird at times... They make some stupid decisions regarding security and the pop-ups for the stupid games and other add-ons are annoying!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Some of my comments don't show up on statuses or photos. Plz fix.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app keeps updating but STILL the main prob I have is when I go to launch the app I have to try 2-3 times to open it. Way to go in offering a quality product!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Personally I think Facebook is great. Although about a week ago it wouldn't log me in and it does this to many other people! Bit of a pain really!'	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It's ok for the most part I give it a 5...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Slow. Lacks the full functionality of the website. Crashes. 1 star.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slower than last version	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's cool	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm on my CPU and this at the same time!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This App is horrible! Always seems to crash and every time you all update it gets worse!!!! Please stop and go back to the basics...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Works perfectly!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
They should consolidate all of the Facebook apps into one app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes at  least  2 times !!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Pics always load just slightly too big in iPhone and I can't do anything to make it fit the screen properly, please fix this!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Installing app - it wants access to calendar and contacts - should be an option to add, not one that is difficult to remove!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I like the app, but when ever you release a new feature you remove others...why? Case and point, I can longer manage Group Admins or create Events in a group from the app. Worked before... why remove it?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I have logged out and back in hopes of resetting my Facebook connection. The little circular spinner just keeps spinning. It's the app that has issue because I can login without issue through a regular browser.  It is getting to the point I'm using it less and less. That might be a good thing. This is through iPhone but my iPad had similar issues.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's extremely helpful to communicate with family and friends.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I enjoy using FB and keeping in touch with people I know.  Please keep our info private.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Cons:1) Can't edit a post or reply!2) Can't edit who can see your posts on your page!3) Tagging people is hit or miss. 4) Can't add a photo to a message. 5) Can only share another post to all friends on your own page and not share it to a group. 6) Can't type in landscape mode. 7) Crashes frequently!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After the latest update, the app takes FOREVER to update.  What happened? Please put it back to the way it was before when updates came thru properly and on time. Why fix something if it ain't broke??!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is awesome.I love hearing everyone's drama xDCause I don't have any :p	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I am new to Facebook. I have avoided the "social media" for my whole life but now I have given in.  I  am now sorry that I have. This Facebook APP does nothing but crash ... CONTINUALLY. Why don't these guys know what they are doing ?  FIX IT, IDIOTS!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't even search up people this is horrible crashes all the time . Sometimes can't even load up pictures, perfectly good iphone 5	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Find old friends, find new friends, or just join group chats, of things you like. Share photos & images. I like this.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

I can't open my profile page at all. It crashes the app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I like FB because it keeps me in touch with family and friends not possible without it.  Having said that, something needs to be done to correct the "flaws".It freezes up all the time, crashes in the middle of typing a comment or even during viewing posts.It is crazy making!  Please fix!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Yea	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I just upgraded my phone to the iPhone 5, and I love the Facebook app on here! The features are amazing and I have had no problems with it! Easy and fast to upload pictures, notifications come in fine, I love how I can save pictures off of here without having to screenshot! Love it!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Incredibly slow.  Can take 30 minutes sometimes for the message you just received a notification for to actually open up!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Deleting the App, what's the point it does not work. Sitting trying to update the news feed for thirty minutes and its on the fast home Wifi... Companies please withdraw your adds as your wasting your money!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
What a crock of poo!With every update this ap just gets worse. Slow is an understatement and as for the new newsfeed view, don't even get me started.I'm only giving 1 star as I like the new chat. Please sort it out	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Best version yet, love it! Clean look, functional and useful and never crashes now.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Updates are quick, on it all the time, never any crashes! If you love FB then this app is for you.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
As far as interactive social media goes you don't get to be top dog on the food chain by disappointing people that being said I've read a ton of negative reviews I don't agree with.  It crashes once and awhile so does everything on the internet most folks complaining probably just need better hand sets.  There's always piggy back apps using Facebook as a means to connect to so it's constantly evolving.  As an artist on numerous projects it makes it easier to have a central go to for pages and groups.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
this app is good for so many things. communication, and meeting new friends, sharing funny things or posting pictures about memories! :) its just amazing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Thank god they fixed the crashing issue!!! Facebook is getting better and better with updates thanks :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Over all is a good app. For iPhone ,and I like using Facebook from my phone ,it keeps me from having to use my computer so much .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's ok	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Its all works pretty swell, every update is more and more helpful,.. Although i would like an "Unfollow" button on the posts im tagged in much like on the official website, i keep getting bugged by comments non-related to me through my phone	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The new update has made my app so slow to load, I get irritated and just give up. Why bother opening the app if my news feed and notifications won't load. It tells me I have notifications but then refuses to tell me what they are. Jerk.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Only doing this cause the app won't stop reminding me to update.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Not a bad app. Just wish they would quit changing it all the time	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
As always -- there has never been a version of this app that worked well -- it takes (comparatively) a while to load/update, whether via wifi or 4G.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I keep liking pictures and then it automatically unlikes it and it crashes after I'm in it for a while	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It goes well on an iPod touch 5, but it still needs to be updated. It is very slow and laggy when it wants to.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Just love it... So easy to keep in touch with family n friends no matter where u r :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I hate the stupid new Sent and Read things on the messages. I know what time it was sent, it tells me when I click on the message. Now I keep getting sent and read mixed up, it's so annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Well it hasn't given me in trouble so far so good	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I wish they would leave Facebook alone. I also wish you could invert a smartphone to have a landscape keyboard instead of a vertical one. We don't need all of these changes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It never works. I shut it down and restart daily and it never works. It the worst app on my phone. Facebook is a billion dolor industry. Why can't they make an app that works??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever since the latest update, my Facebook app freezes up several times a day. It's easier to go to fb via safari..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is the best way to stay connected no matter how much space is between contacts.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
After updating this ap it has become unusable. I had to delete it. I now just use the web version of facebook. Have iPhone 5, fully updated. Annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good way to keep up with friends near and far if you can avoid the drama.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have an iPod 5th generation. So it's definitely not that my device is outdated.Every time I open the app, it crashes.Every time I try to look at pictures, it spazzes and then exits.And my notifications inside the app never match the number outside the app.It used to be such a good app! What happened?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This latest FB update has caused my app to stop giving me Notification updates ...it's really annoying because I have to go a browser to actually see the notifications ...kinda defeats the purpose of having an app!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Most used app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have never written a review but I have to with this app. It is awful. It hasn't worked in a long time. You would think that with all the money Facebook makes they wouldn't buy their software from the dollar store. Please fix the stupid app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Tryin too look at a picture, get the load bar an it's loading...loading...loading... Crash! No more Facebook. Reopen app. Try process again and bam another crash! Want to look through the news feed? Haha! That's a joke. Fix your crap. Shouldn't have this many bugs with very update... I want a Facebook that doesn't crash every five seconds.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My contacts were erased after the latest update - not happy !!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
How frustrating! Tried to update and the app/icon has been stuck on "waiting" for over 24 hrs, can't delete it, can't restart it. Sort it out developers! Why release an update before it's been tested?!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
A veces la app se pega al compartir una imagen.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Does what I expect it to do. No crashes or other issues. I can change things in settings, and I CAN STAY IN TOUCH WITH MY FRIENDS ALL OVER THE WORLD. No complaints here. Thank you fb for making it possible :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Shite.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Ever since the new update comments don't load on my photos. Please sort this out.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I don't know which is worse, the iPhone or the Facebook app for the iPhone. Either way, Facebook you have a lot of crash bugs to fix.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Je n'aime pas la nouvelle version de Facebook parce que lorsque je vais sur une page je ne vois pas les albums... Je n'aime pas.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
you can't see OTHER messages in INBOX!you cant delete your own post in the news feed!too many promotions and marketing that show in my news feed, that i never subscribed!when I click ona photo I want to see the full photo and not how many likes and comments it has.when I click on the photo to remove the details it zooms in and I dont see the full photo"pages you might like"I dont want your pages on my facebook pleaseview previous comments??why cant I click on that?the app is bugging so often I have to delete it and reinstall it.I dont want your facebook messenger so dont put the commercial in my inbox.u say that I have 2 likes on my status but when I click to see who those people are, I only see 1.u say that I have 4 inbox messages but I have only 1.cant view other cover photos on my own page when I click "view cover photo"it says that I have a poke, and when I click on pokes there are none!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Good app. Still need to improve	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Haven't had any issues. A lot better then the blackberry Facebook app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This update is uber CRAPOLA! Each time they've updated FB I've heard complaints but thought 'they're just teething problems' well folks at FB this time I'm saying "you've gone too far, listen to the users".	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
App refuses to upload pictures and update status.... Even retrying does not help this is very annoying	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash! Forget it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Would not trade Facebook for nothing. I have been able to connect with friends I have not seen or heard from in years through Facebook. Facebook is alright with me.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app won't stop crashing since the last update!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
It's very good app when it wanna works but it has it bugs. Sometimes freezes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
- still a lot of kinks in IPAD/mobile app - the one thing I'd like to do is edit comments...news feed lists /notifications aren't up to date. If disliked a page, updates continue to appear on newsfeed...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Useful but slow and glitchy. If you just go to your web browser in your phone and search for Facebook you get a much better mobile version with more actual FB features and less limitations. I prefer that version over this app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
If there was a way to give this no stars, I would. There is NO REASON for a social media app to be THIS resource intensive. I have basically stopped using the app altogether as it crashes 2 out of three times, and freezes my system the ONE time that it does launch successfully. I'm sure you guys are having a high-falutin' time developing for the iPhone 5, but you need to consider that a considerable part of your market still used the 4 and 4S. You have a LOT of one-star ratings right now COME ON GUYS this isn't a fluke.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's legit	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I prefer this app to the web Facebook.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It's terrible! My app keeps on crashing! None of the updates fixed the crashing :/ Everytime I try toMessage my friends the app constantly crashes. I can't even send a simple sentence because it crashes! Also, when I view a photo it either freezes or crashes again! PLEASE FIX THIS!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate Facebook mobile newsfeed. There are so many options like most recent, following, all friends! I hate these options! I don't want to be seeing posts from two days ago that I've already seen! I want it to be in order. Please solve this problem. It's easier on the iPad mobile version.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Update crashes and is slow. Have to open the same thing twice for the alert to get off your phone. Could fix the bubble chat. Also could use more smileys with the feeling section - you have to create your own and the face does not match the feeling.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app is great for what it does and allows you to do.  The only drawbacks for me are the constant policy and privacy changes you have to keep up with.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Tend to find time line very out of date and times. What I see on my iPad will not match time line on laptop ..far to much advertising on it as well. I use FB a lot so will still use it but its not as good on the iPad etc....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
It crashes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I resisted FB but this last Christmas one if my sons set it up and announced to me "you are on FB!"  I am so happy he did that!  I love it and catching up with people I haven't heard from in a long time. I also learn so much!  My husband is always saying "where did you hear that" and I say FB!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Why in the world doesn't FB for the iPhone work in landscape? It's crazy having to type like this. I was able to use Landscape on FB on my old Droid fine although it did crash all the time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app ebbs and flows, but it is back to a terrible mess again. Can't upload a simple picture. One of the biggest things people do on this app and it doesn't work!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great for keepin in touch with friends and family who are spread far& wide	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Can be better .!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Every time I click on a link, the app crashes.  I see that almost every review addresses this issue, so why haven't you guys fixed this yet?  You're seriously slipping on this, guys.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app constantly crashes. On my iPhone, posts are very limited and sometimes don't appear. All that aside; If people would wake up and really understand that Facebook is nothing but the government keeping a super close eye on all its members. Before they took over back in its hey day the idea and functionality of Facebook was okay	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Brilliant app, works really well. Always have updates. Brilliant!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Love Facebook if they had games that can easily download on your iPod touch it would be awsome!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I have a sick child. We do fundraisers to pay her bills. I pd 4 advertising one of them & NEVER SEEN IT on side of page not once nor did my frnds!!! DONT DO IT other than that I like the app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It takes too long to open links, it needs to be improved.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
You asked the wrong person to rate this poor excuse of an app! Unresponsive, slow and unstable on my and my wife's iPhone 4 and our iPad 2.  Very disappointing and frequently aggravating.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't change profile picture through the phone app I have to use my computer. iPhone 4S	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

The App keeps crashing and the new crap slows it down like crazy. How about you guys listen to us and make the app better.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
When I wanna look at pictures it freeze up, I mean it tends to slow down. If you work out that bug, it would be great.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Slow, slow, slow........I suggest you find another social network. This one data mine for the govt and censors its users	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Really slow, never updates properly, takes FOREVER to do anything and for one of the biggest social networking sites in the world this app is a massive letdown.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The latest version is not as bad as previous ones. Push notifications are working the way they should now and scrolling is faster. Not bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I just downloaded the new update and I cannot post any pictures. It shows pictures as posted but it doesn't show on the wall or update on my albums.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
TO MANY BLOODY CRASHES! THIS PROBLEM WITH FACEBOOK HAS GONE ON TO F***ING LONG! SORT IT OUT.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Useless app. The app crashes as it tries to open.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nice way to connect with people and network career opportunities	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The FB app is like any other.. It works, it has quirks occasionally but I use it all the time.. So other than that.. A  few suggestions... a zoom would be nice.. Also a home button where you don't have to back your way out to your feed	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Every time I go look at anyone's page the app crashes on me. :(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I think on the next update, we should be able to change the cover photo on the timeline:)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Great just needs the mood option on status update .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
You can't search your own timeline or history. Bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Sticks all the time plus keeps freezing	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Still rating this 2 stars due to the extensive crashing (I had to restart the app 5 times once), lagging and general dislike.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Stop changing something that's perfect already. You are ruining the app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
As long as you post anti American or that you walked outside, you will have no issues!!! Facebook wants you to be controlled by them and extremists. You are not allowed to think for yourself and comment on your thoughts. They will ban you for speaking your mind!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still needs a lot of updates:( still crashing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I liked better before	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I like it much better than my browser. I can share a photo, and go right back to where I was in my newsfeed, The messaging system is much easier and I like how it notifies you when someone likes or comments something of yours. I really do like it!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love my Facebook app! Easy to access, make arrangements, chat to friends, keep updated with the world when I'm stuck in work. It's social connections at your finger tips that can make life so much easier!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
For start I cannot upload a single video off of any device plus it also is crashing a lot please get it fixed -.-	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
SLOW	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Is great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Without it I would have much less social interaction with far away relatives & friends which would not be good!! I enjoy most of it except top stories selection it needs to be removed.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Nothing to say	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Crashes a lot. Pictures and comments are hit or miss to open. Might as well just delete this and use the desktop version, hardly even worth it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Getting better still few issues tho pictures don't load properly sometimes and ye carnt see other messages only normal inbox	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
The app doesn't do everything that it should to using Facebook...you can't often see videos or pictures and currently it just keeps saying updating- but doesn't update...I reset numerous times a week but find that doesn't really help...Messages need better notification and posting pictures or videos is a pain! Uploading, sharing and general use is difficult :( Very Disappointed!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It seems to get worse with every update. The app freezes and/or crashes way too often. It's gotten to a point to where I have to use safari to do most things on FB mobile.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not sure what's up but Facebook constantly freezes up on my iPhone 5. Have to uninstall and reinstall to get it working again. I'm not a happy camper!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Horrible. Nothing works since the update was done on my iPhone.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Much better speed and flow and status updates have the face things now!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I do no like how they moved the notifications bar to the bottom of the screen; I find it to be very annoying and out of place. I prefer the layout of the version previous to this one. Please change it back.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
What a piece of crap. Slow, hardly ever loads the data it needs. The lack of landscape mode for commenting on status updates, is stupid. Especially when landscape works when commenting on photos. A developer is asleep at the computer at Facebook. WAKE UP!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This update still doesn't low for the portrait/landscape view when posting messages, or viewing pages...oddly though, it works when viewing pictures. Kind of a stupid thing to overlook.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It crashes when you go into someone's picture album , it's so annoying	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Change it back to where you can turn this stuff sideways to text on Facebook!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Still crap. Even with the update, still unable to see posts by others on liked pages.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Half of my posts And comments disappear. It is very frustrating. I also experience long periods of refreshing before the page actually loads. I believe this to be the Facebook app problem because I don't have a problem with this via the browser. I hope this new update fixes the bugs because other than those problems I do like the app. But, having your posts disappear kind of defeats the purpose of being on Facebook.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I would like to see full support of the events on the ap.  Using the Facebook ap, you can set up an event, but you can't edit any details, add co-host, manage time settings, or even add photos.  Might as well not be able to set an event up in the first place.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Just when u think an App can't get any slower ..... u r updating it - gets worse and worse .... a real pain to even use it anymore! What a shame - the earlier "simpler" version were much better!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
There are some glitches, but it's pretty good. Closing for no reason is the most annoying. Also, you should create an option to make a photo a "cover picture."	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
New update, same rubbish. Still can't see my own posts on pages I like, still can't see comments by others in pages I like. Facebook, you are so lame.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Great app! Gets a poor rating because it rarely works properly!! Frustratingly slow and crashes often	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Very slow to load, consistent crashes and just an overwhelming disappointment.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Stop adding features! no one cares! Get the speed going...BY FAR THE SLOWST APP THERE IS!!!Extremely annoying. They could not claim it's due to overuse. Google has just as many, if not, more users and yet works smooth and quick.Highly unimpressed!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the app and use it frequently but I don't like the new layout please go back to the original!!!!!!!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This app keeps getting worse with updates. Where did the "Post from others" button go in the pages I like. It first disappeared from the iPad app a while ago and now it disappeared from the iPhone app as well! Please put this button back so I can see what other people post in the fan pages as I can do on the web version! How hard can that be to bring it back! There has been like 8 updates since it disappeared. How come it has not been fixed yet?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I love the app &' how it's become so easy to use. Especially when I was able to start sharing via mobile. If only we are able to edit where the pictures go in the album such as an order to them, that's would be great. I don't really use my laptop anymore so I hope in later updates I can do this thru my iPhone.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
just updated and my notification, message buttons that sat at the bottom of the screen are now gone, it made searching so much easier...perferred last update...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

So people complain, and you ignore them and add some other useless features rather than fix what needs to be fixed?!This is insane again and again people say you cannot see other peoples posts in timelines on pages or even find tour own post unless someone comments on it and you ignore thatWhy???we need to see at least our own comments!! When I  click on timeline it's only what the page has written :/Who thought this was a Good idea?It's supposed to be social media right?How can it be social if you can't see what anyone had put up?But again rather than fix this you again add pointless things people don't need!!Sigh :,(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I used to be able to go to a friends profile to set the setting to see there post in wall or in my notifications but that option is gone in the app please bring it back also we would like hashtag s so us mobile users can play also thank you	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I updated the app and it stopped working :/	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Why must they always screw around with this app. I keep getting "network error" now & every other app on my phone works fine! Update...once again...& fix this.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever since I updated, the app has slowed to a crawl and continually gives error messages and/or times out on simple requests!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Do you morons not test your "updates" before posting them?!? App freaks out when trying to load a picture, chat doesn't work PERIOD, crashes....Must be nice sitting on a pile of money disillusioned to the rest of the world. And you wonder why you're the internees biggest joke.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Crashes all the time. Cannot access the new hashtag feature on ipod.UPDATE DOES NOT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE! "Network error" occurs when all of my other apps are working perfectly fine with my wifi connection. Disappointing since I use Facebook to keep in touch with friends. It crashes in the middle of all of my conversations.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not working anymore since the update...! Do not update. Horrible update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I need an Easy way to pick and choose what Friends if mine see what! I may post things on here that I don't want certain people, say work colleagues, to see as well.

Before the last update it was good. However, you never know when you can upload videos. You pay for amps and Facebook changes and the amps will not post videos. You can no longer post videos from Facebook amp just photos.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app would be better if I could add videos from my iPhone I don't have the option just pictures updated same review needs to add videos option and be able to have landscape view.

Most RECENT update, since previous update and review...now can't even login! Wish I could assign a downgrade from previous 1-star review.-------------Terrible.

Just downloaded the update. When I opened it after the download, it froze and kept giving me error messages. I had to turn off my phone and restart it and it still gives me error messages. What is wrong with you people??  Every time there is an update, it gets worse and worse. Do you even listen to the users of the app or do you not care?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
All I get now is network errors and crashes. Very disappointing :( easier to just go through safari to Facebook.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Every time you guys update this stupid App it gets slower and slower what is the problem??!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Worked great until update. The FB app worked well in the past. Now it just hangs up and chugs as if it's doing something and ultimately shuts down. Waste of a good blood pressure.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just updated the app and what do you know it's now worse then before ! Very frustrating !	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Update is terrible. iP5!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm sick of the app constantly crashing. I just downloaded the new update and it just improved pointless stuff and didn't fix any bugs. This needs to be fixed ASAP. For some reason it always crashes at the worst times like when I'm in the middle of a long message or something. Well get it fixed!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everything loads EXTREMELY SLOWLY on my iPhone 5. Sometimes things fail to load at all. Using LTE, 3G, or even wifi doesn't matter, the app refuses to load half the pages.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I knew I shouldn't have updated the app!! It took me 4 tries to get in the app without getting a plain white screen. Finally saw timeline after multiple "network error" messages. There is nothing wrong with my phone and the app worked right before the update. What did you do FB???	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
We have the return of the never ending spinning circle....really can this app ever go through one update without it crashing itself.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app says I don't have Internet connection when I do and takes forever to load.. Get this app working correctly cause its annoying how it isn't.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

After the last update, I can't log in	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Learn to fix the bugs and glitches before you send out the updates minus one star rating !!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

After today update, takes so long to log-in, if even..and once logged in it takes so long to load the news feed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

Every time it crashes & takes forever to load	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
One of the worst apps out there.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very slow to get updates. I wait up to 4 minutes some times. Also don't like the ads or their frequency pushed to my news feed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't log in at all after the update. Fix it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Won't go past the loading screen after I updated it. Using an iPhone 4S.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Today's update is just fabulous. Now I can't even open the app. And while you're fixing that bug, maybe allow us to rotate our phones to type into statuses and messages.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Updated facebook now it's horrible!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Update.... Just forced an update today and now the app won't open at all... According to reviews looks like I'm not the only one that this has happened to :(Better than the droid version in my opinion. Smooth and fast, never have connection issues.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Has anyone had a "network error" pop up since updating?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This new update doesn't work. It won't load anything after two restarts of my device. Way to make it worse ...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I have the current update and it crashes a lot and it also says unable to connect to network all the time	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Newest release has too many issues. Just roll it back one version and then try to fix it before releasing it again. Stop making us your beta testers.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
If y'all are going to do an update, make sure it WORKS first ! Keeps crashing.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The newest version had to be deleted and reinstalled after the update after three crashes while opening on my 4S. I liked the less cluttered version from a few updates ago. The chat bubbles get in the way on a small screen. I'm still happy that the share button got added a while back, on the positive side.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Lately it's been so so bad!!! Bugs galore! Sometimes doesn't open.Big problems loading pictures, newsfeed, selecting recent activity or friends doesn't matter.Stopped buffering all the time which is a start. Missing total # of friends in my friends list. Since the last few updates its hard to pull up pictures from your newsfeed. Other than that, making a good step from the original monstrosity that was this app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It's ok but freezes way to much	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I never write reviews, this is literally my first one but I feel it's warranted. The last update completely broke the app (iPad) and made it rash all the time, rendering it almost unusable. The new update made it even worse by keeping the crashing intact, but adding many other issues like comments not loading, pictures freezing and not loading at all, and unresponsive buttons. I know they're working hard to get things right for everyone and it doesn't always work, and the more they know the better they can make the next version. Keep working Facebook crew, it'll come around	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This upgrade is a failure... Crashes only after you upgrade...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This App is junk! The safari is faster and doesn't crash every 30 seconds :/	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Stop updating this app. Please. Every time you's do, it never functions properly at all.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
It's stupid the app is always crashing	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app worked great before I did the update!! Now it keeps giving me a network error when I have full service LTE and on wifi! Won't even refresh! Hope they fix this soon!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Slow, buggy and straight up forgets posts and comments or puts them out of order. As soon as something else comes along, I'm jumping ship.6/18/13 - new update. Now it doesn't work at all. With as much money as Facebook has from farming our data, you'd think they'd at least have a working app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seriously Facebook? Every time there is an update, you fix one thing but everything else gets screwed up. It just doesn't seem like it should be that complicated. Even if you have to start from scratch. Get it right already!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Terrible update. Won't open, won't load things. Messages aren't received in full. Lets fix this mess you've made	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest update 18 June 2013 is very slow now on my iphone 5 and I can't get it to login on my iPad 3 even after a reinstall because it kept timing out after the update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't even get to the login screen now. It won't load. Just sticks on the Facebook splash screen. Tried to uninstall, reinstall, and even restarted the phone. Still nothing.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since update I have not been able to open the app... When it does open it just loads and load and loads.... Nothing changes!!! What's going on here?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes way too much. And freezes.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app was good at first but now it's been crashing a lot and just recently I've been having network errors, I can't even get on the tech support.  I hope you guys are reading these reviews because the Facebook app needs a real update fast.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

This app gets more and more unstable with each update. I made the mistake of downloading the newest version and now I can't log in! You would think that as much as people use FB the app would work a lot better.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just updated with the 6/18 Facebook update in the Apple App Store. Since updating today, Facebook or any game associated with the Facebook app will not load. It was working perfectly until today's update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Forget the new features. Try making something that works. After waiting 5 minutes for my newsfeed to load (it still hasn't loaded and yes, I actually timed it) I decided to come and tell you that you still fail and still merit zero stars.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just updated the app and now it won't load posts past 3 hours or anyone's page. The last update was perfect :/. If I could, I'd redownload it rather than have nothing load.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

After this recent update, the feeds take an extremely long time to refresh. Actually, everything takes a long time to refresh!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Latest update- Fail!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest version(3.3.3) will not allow photo uploads from my iPhone 4. This has been happening for weeks and restarting the phone doesn't fix it. The app is still missing some basic functions of the web site. At this point you would think they could have figured this out.UPDATE (v4.1.1): if I could give this app less than one star, I would. It's horrible. Loading the first screen after launch sometimes takes over a minute. Never less than 20 seconds. Everything it does is painfully slow and buggy.UPDATE (v6.2): I don't know how they do it, but with every new version, the engineers at Facebook somehow manage to make this app more crash-prone than the last. Still launches slow as molasses. Still locks up when I attempt to set the display in my News Feed to "Most Recent" (which it never remembers from one session to the next). I hate this app with the heat of ten thousand suns.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If I wasn't obsessed with Facebook I would not have this app. It is ridiculously slow. Every update just makes it even slower! The time it takes to load, i could have turned on my laptop and opened facebook faster! It doesn't send me notifications, unless it is those stupid "add my birthday" things. It crashes all the time, too. This app needs a lot of work.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the update, both iPhone/iPad Candy Crush Saga can't connect to FB. No game for me tonight...

Facebook app won't even load feed now. iPhone 5 user. Facebook WAS great when it was birthdays, status updates and photo/vid sharing. Now there is too much other "extras" (junk). I'd swap to something else in a heartbeat if so many of my friends and family weren't FB users.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I should have known to install the Facebook update as each time it's disastrous, page won't load up, pic albums won't load up....etc!!! ZERO STARS, doesn't matter anyhoo, I'm fazing Facebook out, soon to be Facebook-less. It's ran it's course.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I like the idea of an update but I think we should get to see what it will look like first as I don't like how all mine has changed at all and we should be able to go back to the old look if we want to.. It was better before this new update	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I'm not sure how its possible, but whoever does these "updates" keeps making the app worse..  How about instead of adding new features focus on CONNECTIVITY.  I'm pretty sure that should be common sense since this is a SOCIAL NETWORK APP...  Seriously, this is getting ridiculous..  It's easily the slowest loading app out there.

Iphone 4: You basically download this app by default if you have a Facebook, but it is a terrible app considering the producer. The app crashes at least once, if not two or three times, every time I open it. If I slide to unlock a notification the app crashes. Probably one out of every ten uses the app crashes randomly while I am using it. While viewing pictures the app tend to crash a lot more frequently. Long story short, I prefer using a bookmarked web page to view my Facebook. For a billion dollar company you think they could produce an app that does its job.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't even get it to load after downloading the update. Have uninstalled until a fix comes.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

App worked fine before today's update.After the so-called update, I keep getting a Network Error when I try to connect. Tried on 3G and Wifi but no dice. I then removed the app, hard booted the phone and reinstalled the app but same issue. I have an iPhone 4, with the latest OS updates so my phone is not the issue. This app is complete crap. And so is Facebook.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
ever since I updated the app doesn't load a thing. No bueno.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time Facebook updates this app, it gets worse!The last couple of updates caused it to freeze and/or crash every couple of minutes. This latest update included the very useful feature of a network error every time it refreshes.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes so much now that it is completely unusable. I literally can't even open the app now after it's most recent update. This is not my phone as all my other apps run smooth.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

What happen to this update? It's not working on my iPhone or iPad!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It doesn't want load bad all	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The two biggest and most conplained-about problems with the previous updates were the remarkably slow loading and the constant crashing. FaceBook decided to remedy this by making an update that crashes just as much and runs even slower. Additional features mean nothing if one cannot even get the app to work long enough to use them.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just updated, now nothing will load and my newsfeed wont update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Had to delete and install after latest update for iPad hd.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It was fine before. Why they continue to update is beyond me. Every update makes it worse. I can't even load my news feed, profile or anything at all. HORRIBLE!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After update can't log in	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Oh thank you i cant log into my facebook you say you fixed the bugs but it gets worse	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The last update, today 06/18/13 has screwed something up	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update is terrible! I have to keep logging in and out to stay connected to it. And I just updated it today! Please fix this!!!! :(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Worst update ever.  Do not update. Crashes repeatedly and hangs up all the other times.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

There is something always wrong. Can't even sign in now! Before the update it was always crashing and locking up. You'd think by now you could get this ap lined out but obviously not.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I was able to log in before the update, but now I'm unable to.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't get anything more recent than an hour ago to load.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes, slow loading, unusable....Facebook should be embarrassed by app updates that render their service completely unusable.  Total garbage.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just updated and now it won't load any content. I log in, and nothing. Loading circle goes until I close the app and re-open, then does it again. I've tried resetting the app and my phone and nothing!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
App won't load after update! Don't update!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The update will not reload the timeline. Nothing loads!!!! 1 star tip fixed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook worked fine on my iPhone 5 until version 6.2. It will not update my newsfeed display the new emotion feature. Fix ASAP! Way to mess up a perfectly good app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I updated my Facebook app earlier today and for those of you who haven't done so yet, DON'T. I've had nothing but issues since I updated the app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This update really messed up the app, well my app at least. It's crashing and nothing will load, my Internet connection is fine, this update needs an update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great a new update that doesn't even work! Fabulous. Bang up job guys.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
For some reason it's not letting me log in at the moment and it crashes quite a lot. :c	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
New update just released and Facebook app doesn't work at all now. Previous update made it crash all the time before this. This app needs to go back and have someone rethink their idea.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App wouldn't load after update. Tried to log out/log in and couldn't get back in. Uninstalled/reinstalled - no help. Can't even load the mobile site through Chrome now. Maybe unrelated but annoying nonetheless.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
New version of the app is horrible.  Hangs all the time and does not update either.  Please fix ASAP.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seems to be trying to do too much. Just present the data. Wait for input. It ain't rocket science Mark.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Don't update! Huge bugs, doesn't load or log in on some phones. Tried wifi, cellular, reinstalling, doesn't work at all.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Something went wrong since the last update ... Oh comeooooooon	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Update led to news feed not updating. When I try to update news feed it says network error even after I've checked my network.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashes at least 3 out of 5 times on the iphone5. Would expect a little better from a company as large as fb.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I always pictured Facebook as an app that was good. As I use it, I notice there are many errors. First, my newsfeed doesn't get updates from some of my close friends, yet feeds many profiles of friends whom I am not even close with.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Needs to be fix this app its a &‰âÂ@&('	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Not able to open notification or emotions need a fix to the upgrade.....	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Regret updating. Things aren't loading. Why is everything at the bottom of the app now? Don't fix what isn't broken. But for the love of god fix this.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app but it keeps on crashing since the update they sent me earlier	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
This is the worst update for this app thus far! Now I have no access to my own wall other than profile picture and cover photo. And it says my photos are unavailable. I think this app has crashed 5 times in the four hours I've updated it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I downloaded the recent update and I see no changes!  My husband updated his and he sees changes.  I tried logging out and logging in and still nothing.  I even deleted it off my phone and added it and still no changes that I can see.  What am I do doing wrong!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This latest update and the last previous one are awful. The app keeps freezing and then it crashes numerous times on the iPhone...please sort this out!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This update is a fail. Takes too long to load news feed. DO NOT UPDATE.  This update version is GARBAGE!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
New version just downloaded. Now it does nothing but spin and spin. Worthless. Horrible.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps crashing since the update today.... Come on!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Basically they had a really cool tab on the side you swiped to get and a familiar look and feel, now it looks like every other wannabe chat services. Why Facebook, pick a design and leave it	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
I love FB but its SO SLOW! And forces close on me all the time. Hardly ever let's me see the latest news feeds.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is always logging me out and I have to restart.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Please fix this it's so slow and my profile is not loading, the update just made it worse	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
iPhone 4 user & after today's update, it STILL takes forEVER to open. Ho-hum. Still want Most Recent as default, especially since it takes do long to load. Just more frustrating to have to select Most Recent after waiting for it to open; then have to wait all over again while it sorts into most recent. Grrrr	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
How is it with every update it gets worse? I can't share what I'm feeling/watching etc. just sits there and says loading. Looks like I'm going back to the web version "/	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Loaded new update an hour ago and since then, it's taken me an hour to post an update; the app keeps freezing; and if it isn't freezing, it crashes.  Good job!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Your looking thru photos and then it turns off and takes you to your home screen , needs to be fixed and stop crashing all the time	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	New Zealand
It crashes too many times and with the new update, it takes too long to log into my account as well as loading newsfeed and uploading picture. So far, this is a piece of crap	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Won't open after most recent update	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It just updated a few hours ago on my 4s, now it's not working.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the latest update the app won't load. Leave stuff alone Facebook!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Did the update and now nothing will load. Uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted iPad and nothing shows up. I let it sit for five minutes and nothing happens.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Was able to open Facebook for a minute but couldn't access my profile or my photos or any of my apps. I uninstalled and reinstalled and now it won't even let me log in! What's going on?!?!?!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nothing will load! I've rebooted my phone and closed out all my apps. This is ridiculous! :-(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With the latest update, the app doesn't open any more.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everything was good until I updated today. Take forever to load and keeps crashing. iPhone 5	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Nothing loads, if and when it does it is slow and takes way too long!! Still not get my notifications. I thought updates were supposed to help not make things worse?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is getting slower and slower with each update.  I wish they would fix the half baked photo upload rather than adding in more sparkles that don't work.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Won't allow me to refresh. And if it does decide to it takes 20 minutes to do so.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Used to be good. Now it crashes all the time. Somedays doesn't even open. Useless!!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

I can't even see my news feed or even my own timeline. Is there an update that actually works like it should!?!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With all that money Facebook has coming in, you would think they could find someone to make a descent, working app for iPhone. The app never reloads and freezes constantly. I'm better off going to the website through safari.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just got notice that there was an update to my Facebook app about an hour ago. Haven been able to log in or link my games since then. I guess we'll be seeing an update to the update before too long. I did like the app before this.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The last update (did it a few minutes ago) did not work. The app did not refresh!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I had to try logging on four times before the new version would let me in. But the real issue is the new friends page. What happened to the alphabet scroll tabs on the right side?? I don't want to have to search for a specific friend, or have those delete buttons there all the time. Bring the scroll tabs back or you will find me on here a lot less....	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Another update creates different problems.  Same old story.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Is the new update some form of a downgrade, because the features I used to enjoy, I AM not enjoying. First it slowed app loading (the most obvious difference) & it crashed once (that never happened before). I thought it was my iPhone 5, but I didn't noticed any difference with my other apps.  Fix everything.......or bring it back to the previous version	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Works 30% of the time. Can't even log in right now. Can't see my videos. Freezes all the time. Yay.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Just did the most recent update and I keep getting "network error" even after restarting phone several times. Terrible update since the app isn't even working properly now.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't do anything now since the app updated	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Really slow & crashes all the time now after it had been working well for quite a long time. And honestly, who cares if you can add "‰ÛÓfeeling happy " onto your statuses. I don't. Just slows it down.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seems like at least most of the issues have been addressed on this new update... It is working smoother (I hope don't jinx it). I will give you guys 4 stars for now... might go up to 5 or down back to 0... hope you stay at 5 this time	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I try to log in but it stays loading and loading wth!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
How about you actually test the build before you deploy it? Your latest version crashed 7 times after updating and now no longer updates the time. I just get to enjoy watching the spinning wheel.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The application is very intuitive and things are easy to fine.  The problem arises when you click on pictures, the app tends to hang for four to five seconds for the picture loads.  This problem is only with showed up in the recent updates.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I've had Facebook installed since the day I got an iPhone, but I deleted it today. Update after update comes, yet nothing improves. It continues to freeze every time I open a photo, and I still don't have a way to change the privacy settings of a pot after I have posted it. Plus, I don't see half the posts I do when viewing the website. And we're all still waiting for the new newsfeed that is supposed to streamline viewing between mobile and web. I'm just done.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have iOS 6 on a iPhone 4S and the app won't even load data. It has never done this. The application is very unstable on my device after update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just updated my Facebook for iPad, primer to updating I had no problem with the page refreshing and viewing comments to my posts, but now it just sets there as I watch the little ring spine around and around and not loading.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Freezes when you load an image. Just get a black screen on my 4s. Does nothing after that. Extremely slow in loading. Like previous reviewer said.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Not pleased with the last update, the advertisements, the messaging system, its slow to react when you try to look at a pic in a post, scrolling lags and sometimes freezes. Now on June 18th this update is way worse. Very slow, freezes, states unable to load tap here to retry and when u tap....nothing happens. Just can't leave good alone. Facebook App has steadily gone down hill over last year. Time to change social networking i guess.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ok. Seriously. Stop updating it. The point of an *update* is that us FIXES the problems. Not ruin it more.Why are you BIGGOTS even *updating* it? Why? Why? WHY? Before V5 it was good. No bugs needed to be fixed or anything.'Lets screw things around ahue ahue'	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Yes every freaking week! You don't need any updates, it's all good, there is nothing wrong with it except for annoying updates. Twitter app doesn't do this so much, look up to them. Another thing, it's always just fine until u update it again, so when it's good, don't update it. If u ever think about updating again, make sure every bug is fixed and this update has no bugs, test it first	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Enough said.  Test updates before releasing them, Facebook!  Had to downgrade back to 6.0 :/	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update is making the app crash and loading super slow please fix soon.. 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Nice update today.  You've made the news feed useless.  It's frozen.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After I installed the latest update, none of my comments I write stay on the post. The comments will show up as soon as I post them. Go back to look at it later and it's gone again.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App won't load on iPhone 5 after new update. How was this not tested?? Tried on LTE, 4G, and wifi. Uninstalled and reinstalled, turned off and on. Nothing.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
- No landscape keyboard.- 'Most recent' option now have to select each time I go back to News Feed section.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Considering the size and scope of Facebook, I can not believe how terrible this app is. It's slow, crashes all of the time, and STILL does not allow me to type in landscape. It should be illegal for any app that requires typing to not allow typing in landscape when the keyboard is up. It's impossible to type in portrait orientation. Fix this!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After a while facebook for iphone became very very slow. Sometimes it takes about 10 seconds to do any action and fot this tine the UI is frozen.It became really hard to use. Amount of ads is crazy: 1 ad per 1 friends update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I couldn't even get this new update to load. I removed the app and now I can't get the whole thing to download! These updates are ridiculous!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The Facebook app is my everyday goto app, now after the update it is crashing every ten seconds or so. Need an update to this update immediately.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Please update so that I can keep my friends from seeing what i like/comment on thats on someone else's page besides theirs or mine. When I comment or like a picture on 1 person's page, I don't need all my friends seeing it. Also, I don't care to see what some of them like/comment on. I mean, their regular posts be cool, but that extra is getting on my nerves. Please update as quick as you can little engineers that could. 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Updated this afternoon, and ever since it has been awful! Seeing posts in my newsfeed from yesterday even when it's set to most recent. Nothing recent shows up! Awful!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
What the $&@k is wrong with you people making this app? You have faile at every version and you suck!!

I try and view most recent status on news feed and it keeps showing me stuff from days ago when I know that new stuff is going on...also if you could add a feature that allows me to block ALL INVITES to anything that would be awesome!

Nothing at all has changed on my iPhone 5 but the same update looks completely different on my girlfriends iphone 5 - both running latest ios and Facebook 6.2?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
After an update! My Facebook app is exactly the same. It will not change at all. Yet if I login to any other account, it's already updated!! FIX IT please!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Can't even sign in. Just loads and then says error.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Doesn't sync with contacts or calendar anymore. What's up with that?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Being that you are focused on mobile your app is terrible yet okay. Number one add landscape - if Messenger can do it so can this app. The new layout is terrible! Also another really annoying thing is that I never get push notifications anymore when I have them enabled. Fix this please! Crashes happen periodically and are annoying. ONLINE STATUS FOR DEAR GOD THEY NEVER ARE ACCURATE. THIS IS SUCH A NUISANCE - JUST NO. And photos are forever taking to load (not normal). Oh and I would give this a 2.5.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Can't connect to Facebook with this latest update. Every attempt leads to a "Network Error" error message. I've had no problems with the previous versions.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I swear to god if you don't issue an update with bug fixes for this app I'm dumping Facebook entirely.  It constantly crashes and functions clunky at best.  There are other social media outlets.  F'n fix yours or I'm dumping it.  And getting a large response to a status update to that effect.  What the hell is your problem?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Updates for what they dont do anything same ol things over and over how about adding a unfollow button cause i hate posting on someones status only to be going on forever ..'!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I do NOT like the new update, I wish it still had the four icons at the bottom of the screen. :(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can yo make this app more like the htc facebook phone	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I log in & instead of swiping to the left to get to my profile, events, pages, etc. I get this black bar at the bottom which says News Feed, Messages, Contacts, Notifications and more, which is annoying and not the correct format	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After I installed the update u just release I open my fb and start to talk to people and it still crashes....it's not my iPad its ur app. FIX IT!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The newest update won't even start up.  Why can't you people leave well enough alone? The app continues to crash and now you changed the layout of home pages to where people can't access photo pages anymore. I used to be able to access different albums of different liked pages and now I can only see recent photos.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
6.2 -Still unacceptable. Start composing a comment. Minimize the app, bring back the app and the comment vanishes. This did not happen in prior versions. I reported this in 6.1. Facebook developers did not fix it. They must cease all new development until existing features are restored. 6.1.1 - Still unacceptable. New bug. Start composing a comment. Minimize the app, bring back the app and the comment vanishes. This did not happen in prior versions. Facebook, fire your developers and suspend all new feature development until you fix all the defects in the current version. Make what you already have work and stop breaking things. 6.0.2 - View previous comments fixed. Add a comment thread to a Group and it double posts until it updates at some point.  Of course, now updates take forever. Click a posted picture and 90% of the time this version will crash. Again, I call for the firing of Facebook's incompetent programming staff. Your users are not your beta testers. 6.0.1 Broke the "View Previous Comments" feature on long message threads. It works the first time you visit the long thread and tap it. But, when more are added after that point, you can only see the first 10 and last 10 comments with no way of loading all the ones in between. Didn't anyone test this before release?  Worthless. Useless. Round up your programmers Facebook and fire them. 5.5 Intolerably slow and buggy. I cannot use it reliably. Fix it!5.5 Slowest updates yet. Fire your incompetent programming staff Facebook. 5.2.1 Notifications feature is still broken. That's three strikes in a row. Toss your programmers out, FB and stop treating your users like guinea pigs. A possible workaround for the Notifications defect. Log into the Desktop (not the Mobile) website and reset the Notification count to zero there. Sheesh. 5.2. The count in Notifications is still never accurate. I finally learned if I go to my profile, I can delete an errant post. Amazingly counter-intuitive and inconsistent design. Fire the software development team. Another disaster. I've had to hard reset my iPhone at least twice because of this buggy update.  Tagging is broken (still). The notifications feature is now completely unstable. I keep getting notifications of status updates I've already read. Update to the update. Tagging sometimes works. It's still unacceptably buggy. Now, pasting something to a message I've started will cause the message to be cut off at the insertion point. I can't Remove a post on my status update either. I have to log in via Safari, tap-sweep right and tap Remove. This used to work in the app and they broke it again. When is Facebook going to hire some testers?Another update. Still no tagging. When is Tagging ever going to work in the app?I can tag in the Desktop Site version through Safari, but now the Groups feature broke on the iPhone Safari Desktop Site version. Facebook has to fix these things.Oh, and in the latest update, some of my settings were reset yet again.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am sick to death of Facebook crashes! My phone has almost ended up smashed a few times from your inability to make an app that actually works fluidly . I have deleted and redownloaded many times! sick of it freezing too! your app is atrocious! pull your head in!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I would like to be able to use it in "lancape mode " for my iPhone 5, :(And another thing I am NOT HAPPY is: I cannot select/ choose between my already exist albums of photos to upload more pictures to them. ( just let me choose between a couple,..... Exactly the ones I'm not looking for) :'(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So still no landscape mode for typing?So instead of one app for everything I pretty much HAVE TO have Facebook Messenger as well so I can type in landscape?Facebook, what happened to you?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app crashes alot, unless you are patient, just go on safari or google to get into your Facebook it is better on there.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have a few minor complaints about Facebook in general, such as the annoying ads, and the new feature that allows people my friends have followed to appear in my news feed, but on the next update of the app I would love to be able to disable the "show in newsfeed" option for my friends and pages.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Please fix this problem. Keeps crashing after a second of launching it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Still cannot view recent post by others on liked pages like we could before the last update. FIX THIS!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is totally useless and gets more lame every update. Constant freezing, crashing and just being overall slow. Stop adding useless icons and just fix the speed, crashing and freezing problems. I just don't understand how hard it could be to make a stable app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest update only shows a few of the most recent updates then jumps back to yesterday.  Ridiculous!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Cool	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Yo Facebook! App crashes when updating the news feed? Network error even though I have LTE? You guys would get a one star if I couldn't actually use the app. Get it together and make your app useful with iOS! Jeez	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's annoying that when you're scrolling through messages it closes because of the new update	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It has been trying to update for over an hour!! Get it together!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Diggin the new layout. However, it's a pain that I have to constantly switch the status updates to "recent." If I always want to see the most recent, I shouldn't have to always re-select it. Also annoying is that whenever I get notifications in the groups I follow, when I open the page, there's no recent posts shown. Makes no sense!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The interface is complicated	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
It crashes alot we needa fix it ASAP	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook is acting up it the chat heads our not poping up its Not showing the mesges it's not working good every since I update it	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My messages won't update. They either say active now, active now but says 1m, or active 1+hours. It no longer says like active 15m ago..if this makes sense. Fix it, this is annoying! Other then that..works fine	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Often crashes on this version, hoping for a fix	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great update to the bugs found in version 6.1. The app is now fully functional and more importantly, usable. "Animation" sequences (opening chat heads, photos, etc) no longer freezes.Still hoping, however, to be able to delete comments/posts within the app one day.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This update looks cool and nice and faster	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
LANDSCAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Morons who program this app. Why are you so stupid!?!? LANDSCAPE ORIENTATION IS BASIC FUNCTIONALITY IN IOS. It was there initially! Why would you take it away???? And the new version moves things all over the place. It doesn't match the online version. What are you thinking???	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I use daily... All day. Not loving the crashes or when I write a comment & it doesn't post... Seems to vanish in thin air. Otherwise, LOVE this app-it's my fav & most used! please make it easier to "unshow" people from newsfeed from mobile version. Thank you for always making improvements!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

takes up a lot of space, I don't know why... It feels like it should e so simple, yet it takes up a ton of space and is really slow. No apparent increase in speed from data to wifi. I don't look to this app in order to reach my friends, which is what facebook is about isnt it? Really didn't step it up with this app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Why'd you switch back to the old navigation? I so much preferred when you could switch want screen you wanted to be on (news feed, home page, etc) on the bottom now it's back to the old upper left corner.. Not as easy/nice layout..	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Wow you just took 2 steps back.  Absolutely ruined the GUI. Stupid cant be fixed with you people.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app gets progressively worse with every update!  I thought it was my phone but its the crappy quality of the app.  The last time my phone took less than 30 seconds to update my news feed was last winter!!!  Then when I tap in most recent, it gives me news from a week ago. Really Facebook?  Get with the program!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Ok so it seems that the crashing & lack of updating is not getting better with this new version unfortunately I'm still missing post that are able to be viewed online. As well I went to share a pic on a friends timeline & the post button does not work!! I got asked to do a survey by Facebook when I opened the app. So I clicked it & it crashed. Then it was gone. It's got so many bugs that never get fixed!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
How about instead of giving updates to change stupid icons you give updates to actually fix the problems! Like taking, forever to load anything, or just unexpectedly shutting down, or duplicating statuses.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's great communicating with family and friends either by chatting or video chat, but it crashes too much both on iPad and iPhone. Please update with bug fixes.  Uploading pictures can still be a hassle at peak times.  Would love to get more privacy back!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes allllllllll the time.. Super slow... Freezes then crashes... It's like it's being ran by a bunch of senior citizens.. You'd think with all the MONEY FB is cashing in that they could have a really good reliable app... C'mon zuckerburg!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Just updated to the June 18th release.My news feed now only show the first 20 stories. Won't load any more. (The friends feed and following feed do.)	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
6.2 *Still* lacks portrait mode support.  Can't use a landscape keyboard, plus anyone who uses a keyboard case is stuck turning their head sideways to use Facebook. Usability fail. Comments on pics are now unresizable and kind of a joke to try to read too. Landscape does still work for pics, and oddly you can comment on pics in landscape... But $deity forbid you want to post a status horizontally because you have big thumbs. 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app doesn't even deserve one star! It crashed literally every ten freaking seconds! It can't even stay up for five minutes! It is the most frustrating app EVER!! I also freezes and I just hate it SOO much!!! You might as well go on the Internet instead!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate that I have to constantly select "most recent" to see all posts in my news feed. This wasn't the case in the older versions. I just want to be able to come on Facebook and see all my friends posts in chronological order without having to always select "most recent"... And then have to wait 10 seconds for the slow app to respond.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok I like the app.. But it crashes way too much and it's annoying. I could be in a middle of a conversation, writing... Then, gone, the app crashes.. I don't know why but they need to fix that. I have to go on the computer to be on Facebook that's how much this app crashes. I don't know if its just my luck or others are experiencing the same thing but I'm just about ready to delete this app.. I'm hoping the developers could come up with an update that will address this problem because its frustrating..	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Was the best app I got until the last update and now when I try to go into the app it will kick me out of the app I could have the best wifi or serves and it still does it :(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is so extremely slow, I can hardly even use it anymore. Profiles never load, and it takes minutes for anything at all to load when I open the app. It gets slower with each update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is the only app that doesn't work right on my iPhone 5. Extremely annoying. Never plays videos or opens pictures. POS APP	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

All the new features are great, however you should take a look on the really annoying bugs! Specially the one the makes the app crash all the time!Thank you!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I like that they updated that you can show emotion status updates.. But dislike that the layout of the chat , timeline and options were in bottom of screen on app ... It needs to get switched back ASAP didn't think that was going to be changed its easier accessible	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Horrible app. Crashes EVERY time I go on it. Can't even use it anymore!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I never opted for timeline, it happened on its own. Facebook must have some advantage for this happening, because there would be an option to go back to the old format.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook use to be fine and good. NOW it's complete trash :/ its confusing and I don't like it at all! Change it back to when the notifications thing are at the top! I'm so use to that! Now its just confusing.....	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'll admit, things have started getting better and the redesign is growing on me.  I simply wish that you could watch HD videos.  I have also had issues with things being a bit laggy even on my new iPad 4th Gen, and my iPhone 5.  If these could be fixed, I wouldn't mind the app, and I'm glad their trying to improve it!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

The app crashes every time I open it! Plus, pictures take forever to load and there is STILL no support for landscape mode!! Come FB, get your act together and fix this app!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
On the latest update, Facebook is extremely slow taking over five minutes just to load a page or the news feed. It crashes several times while loading and crashes immediately after reopening the app. It's also missing new features that were supposed to be in this latest update. Probably the worst Facebook update yet. I'd give it 0/5.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Uninstalled reinstalled logged out back in wont load I'm on wifi have perfect Internet the update screwed everyone... iPhone 5 32GB	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is HORRIBLE I just did an update and can not log in at all. I have to go through the Internet! UNACCEPTABLE!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My chat isn't working no more The update messed it up Sad 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app crashes too much. Horrible app	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok but populated by the least self confident people.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
it works for a bit but then it crashes out of nowhere several times-.-	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
the 1 update i been waiting for is when will we be able to decide which picture or status we want to share with public/friends/ or keep it private etc from the app? doesnt allow you to make that change on statuses and pictures yet 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Really sick of this. I haven't been able to use Facebook for almost a week now. I'll just use the Internet on my phone. Nothing will load, can't see pictures, an it crashes constantly. Uninstalling.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have a job and a life, which is why I keep chat disabled. The new update includes "Chat Heads," an infuriating chat bubble system that is annoying and obtrusive. There is no way to disable this "feature." Meanwhile, battery drain increases to 1% every 3 minutes on standby. Reverting to the previous release solved the issue. Avoid this travesty like the plague.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's way to slow to load up my news feed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just installed the new update and it's so much less functional than previous versions. The bar on the bottom is distracting and the options it gives are lacking. It seems like a step back from older versions.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Constantly crashes when I pull up pictures. Super slow and now I'm unable to see hash tags entries similar to mine...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I updated the app and now it's not even on my phone c'mon man! Plus I can't even uninstall it to re install it what a POS	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
They actually make the app worse every time they update !	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
The update will not load anything! Went back to using my browser to access Facebook .	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am quite surprised by this change, when I first updated it was the nice column format. Still was even after, but after awhile it changed. I liked the other format better cause everything was where it was needed. You guys have a problem with keeping an app to look the same on OSes that are different and on this one.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
App keeps crashing. Doesn't work at all for me. DO NOT UPDATE.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Not only is it slow, it crashes so much! It'll exit me out mid conversation.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm trying to prevent certain Facebook friends from seeing some comments or likes that I make on Facebook photos or posts. However, I don't want to unfriend these friends. Can you please add certain privacy tool to help me control who can see my likes or comments on photos or posts??	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't look at my own likes plz fix!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app has huge jumps in time on the news feed. I have to open, close, and reload it several times to get it to show me a complete newsfeed without huge jumps in time. Needs work!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Downloading app..... STILL WAITING MORE THAN 20 MINUTES LATER!!!! 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes ALOT! I just don't bother to click on the app anymore! -.-	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app is way to crashy I can even scroll down my news feed without it crashing, I can't talk to someone on chat, I can't even look at a picture. Please fix this, it has gotten way worse than the previous update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
FB freezes! Have to turn perfectly working iPad off & on to get it to work for 2 mins. then repeat over & over! Junk app!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I constantly get dinging notifications. I open app and there is nothing. What's up with that??	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Won't update to the latest version!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps crashing, picture issues, etc..every update gets worse and worse.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like that you can unfriend people from your friends list without having to open their profile, but there is no alphabet tab on the side to make scrolling through the friends list easier...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Slow, crash, Slow, crash. Repeat.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashed my phone and I lost all of my apps.  Went to the Apple Genius Bar and retrieved most; however, the Facebook icon is gone completely and I can't delete and reload because the software is in the phone.  Nothing they or I have done has worked.  Extremely frustrating - should never updated!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps telling me there is one notification, yet I'm unable to find a recently not yet seen notification. PLEASE consider providing a landscape viewing option. Thanks.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This is CRAP! My FB Icon is Completely Gone and the only way to login is thru web browser.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have only had this app for 2 hours.  In that time this app crashes seems like anytime I want to share something.  It freezes and does not let you see your entire wall.  You can't scroll down after a certain point it is all greyed out and doesn't load the rest of the page.  When I have gone to a friends page only shows you their profile pic.!  Never have I had this much problems with any Facebook app!  Facebook please fix this now!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook for iPhone is like a drunk driver - constantly crashing.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Laughably slow, constantly freezes, delivers half the news feed. I expect a lot more from a company of this magnitude. It is almost unusable	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Great app just wish they would put landscape mode back plz plz plz put landscape mode back	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It dosnt feel like Facebook anymore. Put the icons back at the top. It just looks like a cheap ugly version.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slower than molasses. Crashes way to much. Says I have notifications, messages, & friend requests when I really don't.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Yes, it crashes a lot, freezes, loads very slowly a lot... But my biggest complaint is that when I want to type any kind of text, whether it be a status update, comment, search, or whatever, I can't turn my phone sideways for much more optimal, speedy typing. That bugs the heck out of me!!! (On my iPhone 4)	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The black notification pane on the bottom is annoying. And the chat bubbles? Even more annoying.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Thx . This update is great	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It takes me about 4 tries just to open the app without it crashing, then I can barely do anything on it without crashing. All the images and info on the newsfeed takes forever to load. If I scroll through it before it's done loading, the app crashes; if I let it sit there and wait for it to finish loading, it crashes. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT IT CRASHING!!! >:(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok app, but sometimes when I post a comment on someone's status it will stay a second and then disappear. Does anyone else have this issue?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Updating the features does not necessarily improve the user experience. App is still slow and crashes often.Btw, the Messages tab and the chat heads are redundant.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This Facebook app it's full of crashes, if you guys are going to do something, do it right	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It worked well until the update because my app got erased somehow. I just updated it and didn't touch it. Now when I try to install it, it just says Open. But when I press open nothing happens.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Within about, the last 3 months, the Facebook app has been randomly closing down itself constantly! And it freezes all the time. plz fix this if possible! :(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

News feed keeps randomly going back to the top when reading through it. Need the ability to set newsfeed to "Most Recent" ONLY!So the update on 19/6/13 did NOT fix these issues! Ace! (Sarcasm)	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

it's a good app to have so I don't always need to go on my laptop and its quite fast but whenever I get a push notification saying I have a message and go onto it it crashes my app when I've just typed back say a massive paragraph! that's the only thing I hate	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
The app crashes every time I'm on. News feed u can't do anything, comment like or share. If it has a photo u can't event look at it cuz the app crashes. I can't search people or it crashes. I HATE this new app. Can't use it at all!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I know the app will never be close to the desktop version but WOW! The ads are annoying and "suggested" apps are too. The order of "most recent" posts are ridiculous! How can I have a status listed first if it was posted 2 hours ago..followed by one supposedly sent 1 minute ago? Fail. iOS 6 on 4S. Dissatisfied.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It won't open, crashes immediately since the update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

They should add the webcam face chat on the app since its already on fb website y not have it on mobile as well	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
If I'm on my iPhone and I get a Facebook message that pops up near the top of my phone, if I click it, it brings me to a blank Facebook app and about after 5 seconds it shuts it off. Also, even just clicking the Facebook app button, it sometimes takes a few times of clicking it before it actually stays open and loads properly. Please fix because I love FB	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Can't look at comments. Slow to refresh, if at all.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm ready to smash my phone to pieces every time fb tells me I need to continue to update my info. Like every single detail of my life, my phone number, address, exactly what I studied at school.. Etc... If I wanted to share that info I would do it on my own. Sick of being hackled leave me the F alone already!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
We need a Dislike button that after so many dislikes the comment or photo will be removed .. Add the option to let us be able to add photos to conversations after they've been started.. Thanks	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It is impossible to change your cover photo using the app. I can easily change my profile pictures, but there is no option for cover photos.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Freezes too much. I just quit using it. It wasted too much of my time.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Friends that I choose t get notified of their status updates goes away after 2 wks and I have to go back on the COMPUTER and redo it all again. This app is horrible. Get your sh*t together, Facebook!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I use it every day	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have no idea what has been coded, but the app is quite slow and it is crashing a lot. The prior app was way better.Crash crash crash slow slow slow...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
-Photos zoom in so you miss the edges. -Needs a prompt on home screen for birthdays. -Tagging photos isn't always possible until you click off and on again. -If you use Facebook for a business and tag a lot of photos it flags up on security settings and blocks you. -Needs an iPad update as it's still running on iPhone app	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Obviously your market is everyone! So, I'm guessing the iPad app cannot keep up with so much on the page...I purposely close all apps first before I open FB to prevent crashing.  This does work, but only for awhile.       I do love pages and the versatility and the way other sites can interact with it.  Privacy settings are a great help. Sometimes too much is too much.     You get four because there's really nothing else out there to compare it to.   It's where my friends are.  That's the whole point right?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It force closes at times for no reason. The news feed never seems to stay in the setting you choose?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Since the last update I don't like much espesially when I'm writing messages and  a friend replies as well as when i log on, I don't like the bubble notification of a friend when they wrote me a message!......they should've left it at the top left were the other notifications are.......These options should be available on both. Computer AND the ipad!Using my ipad:               I can't delete specific messages; I can't block specific friends on chat; I would like more smiley faces and little pictures/symbols whatev you call them; with our status we should be able to post what mood we are in.......we should be able to choose a mood that already has the smiley....BUT also be able pick our own smiley/symbol/picture AND be able to type our mood in, with no letter limits, so we can type more than one word!!!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Well it used to work perfectly fine but since it's last update my newsfeed hasn't refreshed and won't refresh.. I'm currently viewing posts from when I last updated which is soo annoying! I've tried many things to get it to refresh but now nothing loads, including my page or anyone elses. Sooo frustrating, I recommend not updating !!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The app was working perfectly for me.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This app constantly closes out randomly at any point, also doesn't always show my notifications even when they are on. The notifications that do pop up are never the right amount that I have. I personally think this app is terrible and very frustrating especially when your trying to do something and it just closes. Also pictures sometimes do not load, and when I click on pictures sometimes it closes out the application.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

For theist part it's not to bad   Put could use some work. It closes on you for no reason and it loses you place a lot when messaging people it just shuts down. When looking up things on the Internet it gets info not related to what you were wanting u have to go thru a bunch of it to find what your looking for but all to it just depends on how you use it as to the problems or bigs r in it  would be super nice if it was fix for everything  but it takes time. I love me apple this is the 5th apple iPhone I have own apple is kool iny book. Keep trying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I don't even get a notifications at all when someone comments on my status, pics or anything, I've wrote this same review for months now & you guys still haven't fixed the bug on this app grrr 	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
It freezes than u have to wait a long time before you can do anything on it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I like the update! I keep getting the wrong no. On the fb icon, it'll have 12 on the icon, open it and there is 7. What the heck?? Also, I can't see the number of friends someone has. I use to be able to see that, when curious.   I'd like to have  a favorite page for business page.  Overall I like the improvements! I'm really excited about changing my profile cover pic on my iPhone. Keep the updates on the ease of use and I'll be a happy guy.  4-26-13 the upgrades are much better! I live the new messenger. I still have a issue with the numbers of comments being correct.  I'd like to see you upgrade the ability to see birthdays. It's a little cumbersome now.6-21-13. The latest upgrade is good. I use the mobile app the most. I like the lower bar, and ease of use. I hope in the future upgrades you make birthdays more accessible, I find it still to be a pain to look up daily.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This app takes foreverrrrrr to update my feed. Most of the time when I get on it in the morning after not being on all night it won't even open it crashes bc it can't update. It's been this way for months and every time there is an app update I think yes finally they will fix the problem... Nope they just add stupid stuff like chat heads. Fix the problems you have Facebook instead adding more stuff to bog it down	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I love facebook but it seems to crash more now that its changed. Whats with this ??	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I'd have to say this is one of the most frustrating apps I have ever used! It's definitely crashbook!!!! It crashes frequently and the app is true slow. It's not my phone either. I at times have to use safari just to get something done on my Facebook so I know right then and there its the app!!! Come on mark z u created FB from a dorm room do something better with the app please and thank u very much!!!June 21 - now the share attachment won't work....stating there is an error!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I primarily use a list to view what I find important because the news feed is highly inaccurate and overwhelming. This update ruins this by bugging out and switching to News Feed every time I open it, which often causes unforeseen issues. Additionally, the new message system should be voluntary; it's more annoying than anything else. Look, this stuff worked fine before. Why change it?Oh, and if I wanted to have updates notify me, I'd have set it up to do so. As I don't want to, STOP TELLING ME HOW.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The Facebook App was much better before the last few updates. I'd much rather have a smooth running app VS some silly new features. I'm tired off turning my phone off and on, just to update my news feed.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It's crashing to much what when I get on it logs me out!!!!!!!FIXXXXXX	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Facebook needs to change its ways or it will loose a lot of people.  You are stating to control to much of what/how/when we post.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The facebook app is ridiculous and terrible, it crashes every time im on there and instantly shuts for no reason. Also it wont let me open my messages and it will say cannot connect! Its stupid and im fed up with it to be honest.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I can get on the app fine, but the feed says no content. I have refreshed over & over & nothing happens. also, it's very slow.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hasn't worked since the update. Crashes or repeatedly demands my password. Fix please!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
You can't see any comments on posts and 9/10 pictures won't show! What's the point of an update if it makes things worse?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sick of tired of try to protect my privacy against Facebook.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the overall setup	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
My App will say I have somewhere between 3 & 10 notifications but when I open up I only have 1. Fix Please	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I actually like Chat Heads and stuff. Yes the app needs speeding, but every time i go to an About page, the app logs me out and now i can't connect properly. Messages and Photos won't load	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This last update has been the worst. Doesn't show all comments on posts, takes ages to update, hours between posts, have to automatically adjust every time to show most recent posts...needs fixing!! WORST UPDATE EVER!!!? Not happy!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Update the app then it keeps crashing, can't see people's comments log off and now can't log back on. Shocking!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I constantly try to update my status & add pictures & every single time is says upload failed!!!! I have to try it about 6 or 7 times to get it to load!!! The problem started once I did the update for the app	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is a great app, but there are some things I can still only do on a desktop or online that I can't do on the app (change my cover photo pic).	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Since upgrading I can see a status but can't see any comments, just the names, date/time and if to like or been likedAnother joke from fb!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I can't even log in anymore! On my 4s! It says login error! Fix it! Nowwww!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Je l'aime cette version je peux effacer mes conversations y'a plus de visages sourires et je peux partager certains vÌ©cus de mes amis bravos!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
My comments that I get, they don't show! It's getting frustrating having to close the app & reopen it. Half the time it works. Very irritating! Not to mention that NONE of my albums are showing! Very disappointed.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Now I can't log in.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Current version lost my timeline and does show my posts.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My status has disappeared.Please fix!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It won't let me update my status... Please fix thanks... The status will not upload...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is ALWAYS behind the browser in terms of currency of posts. Some bad caching going on.And today they have switched off browser access in Safari at least. Dumb and Dumber.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Ever since I downloaded the new update, I can't upload photos now. Please do something and fix it. I'm tired of seeing "upload failed"	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is THE WORST app I've ever used. Bunch of idiots.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since updating the app it no longer works. it won't let me log in at all, useless	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Why bother to update something in such a way that makes it far less user friendly and far more irritating to use?Now when I avoid the app, due to it being as responsive as a 6 week old tomato, I can't even use safari without it prompting me to use the app. Terrible!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
When I go to my notifications and click on one to see the comment, the comment isn't showing up. Just shows the person's name. I've restarted my phone and didn't help. Also, the app never stays on "most recent" posts. Always returns to "news feed," which is not the way I wish to view people's posts. Today, when I do sort by most recent, it isn't updating. It's showing posts from several hours ago, but when sorted by news feed it shows posts from less than an hour ago.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the update I have not been able to share ANY status updates! What the heck have they done?? The only way I can share it is if I don't write a post about it!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I updated it and now i cant even log on. What the actual fook! :@	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Can't even open the app	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why is the news feed jacked up right now?  It starts off with the most recent & then skips about 3 hours of postings. I don't like how we have to keep selecting "most recent" every time I open the app. Is there a way we can set & save our news feed preferences instead of having to select it from the drop down menu every time we open the app?  Otherwise I love it!  Thanks.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The pictures do not expand. When you click on a picture to see it the screen goes blank.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This app will not update. I deleted it and re-downloaded it but it still is not updating. Fix This Please!!! I'm currently using FB through my Safari browser...which is annoying!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is stupid crashes shows blank pages shuts its down whenever it wants only displays a few of my pages. Seriously facebook? Get better program.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It alway exprie. I hate it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Awful, gets worse with every update. 'Last seen time' on chat isn't accurate and says I'm online when I'm not. **updated review*** AGAIN, crap update. Can't seem to go on other people's profile as it won't load properly/can't see some comments. I've JUST downloaded it... I'm sure there are lots more wrong with it, however these are the two already annoying things I've noticed thus far. Sort it out! Facebook is some people's mostly used app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I love using Facebook on my phone it's a nice fast way to skim all my friend's posts.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app is pitiful. One reason I bought an IPad was to do the things I love. This has been a huge disappointment.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Very buggy!...posting something with a picture is a crapshoot. You never know if its going to post. When it does it posts 2x!...that silly bubble for messages is annoying and they finally allow you to remove it...privacy is of upmost importance and somehow people I don't know can read my posts etc.  despite the privacy filters...such is the life of being on social media!...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Tried to go to some friends timelines and won't load. Went to other friends comments to read and comment on but couldn't comment cuz comments posted by other people were not available to read. Didn't want to jump into a conversation that I can't read. Please fix this.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Gets the job done, but closes all the time and restarts!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Latest update won't even load half the time and crashes OFTEN. Also dramatically slower than previously. This is a poor version which should have been fixed by now. Just keeps getting WORSE. iPhone 4s	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm frustrated with this app, every since it said to update the gn app I can no longer download it. I keep getting the pop up of unable to download at this time retry or done. Fix please, I didn't have this problem with my S3	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hangs on updating the newsfeed and becomes totally unresponsive. Disappointing experience.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Keeps booting me out! Then I need to log back in & can't! This last update is horrible! Totally slow! New update please!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love Facebook's new update was waiting for "feelings". Only problem I have is that every time I go to write a status the option to add a photo to the status comes up first. I checked that I wasn't pressing the photo button but I wasn't. It's much of a frustration. Also it would be more convenient to have everyone's statuses in order as a default fit news feed because I do not understand how to change it. Because "most recent" only shows what I've missed. Thanks	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
It won't load new updates.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have had a fb for a long time and now it is just a drama fest for kids, ads, and games. It should go back to the way it was about 2 years ago. It is starting to look like myspace :/ ALSO! All the update must have something wrong with them, because the app almost never really works. I can go to one or two different screens then I have to come out, close it out and start over. It's slower than all the rest of my apps and freezes all the time. On a better note: Facebook has been a great way for me to connect with old friends and distant far off family.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I'm happy that Facebook got an update. But it is horrible! It takes forever to load my newsfeed and most recent. Facebook should have a setting how you want to see your news feed. And it is starting to freeze and crash. Once more, I'm not happy with this update!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Wont let me send photos in messagesalso very slow when i tap on pictures.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Terrible update. Keep having blank comments with just name and time but nothing in the comment. Posts not submitting	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
News feed does not include all the people on my friends list....	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Last update did nothing for me. There are breaks constantly. Of course I was t on while I was sleeping so why can I only see like six posts from today and them last nights. And I posted a picture, I have an iPhone, and it's tiny. This all needs fixed	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Lol	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still learning, but like it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good appIt's really missing the landscape viewFew crashes but still usableThanks for it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Only doing this so the request stops popping up	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Come on Facebook. Stop killing my battery	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
That is all so basically I can't do anything?!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I love FB!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Why does Facebook close without ever opening? It has happened several times where I log on and I'm sent back to my phone. Also, why can't I respond to a comment at the actual comment instead of adding yet another one?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I have to reinstall the app SEVERAL times a day just to get it to refresh...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app on  iPhone, very similar to  (pc) version on iPhone......	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Ever since the most recent update, I've had no issues. Unfortunately, it's taken 3-4 updates to get this way,	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Please fix app keeps freezing and cutting out not happy at all !!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Why is this being shoved down our throats?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app won't not ask me about making a review even when I tell it no thanks I'd never like to write a review. But here's my review o the review of this. Meh.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is great. I use it everyday.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
1- love the inchat smiles revamped2- THE UPDAT BLOWS!!!! It is freezing my app, it is slow and I cannot edit my friends category's from my phone I have to result in removing them.3- I hate that I cannot simply delete my face book account I have to put it on hold.4- this crap goes for the previous up dates, if I wanted my whole life on this stupid site I would go make a billboard to give my number out and personal life story.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
90% of the time this app doesn't work, and when it does it's incredibly slow.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
PLEASE let us turn it SIDEWAYS to type...PLEASE put in a Landscape feature. And STOP freakin CRASHING all the freakin time!!!Even after yesterday's "update" this app crashes more than Stevie Wonder at a Demolition Derby. I DO like the chat bubbles, however.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Crashes more than all my apps combined times 2! Actually crashes more than all the apps I ever had. It's regularly crash on launching it 3 times in a row. Only use it because its the only Facebook app. This app is annoying (times 2)!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sometimes freezes when I tap a picture. At times I have to reboot my phone to unfreeze. Message indicator is screwed up. When the app shows I have three posts, that means I actually have one.At times it closes on its own.All the 'fixes' haven't fixed much. Go back to the original.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Eh...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why am I getting notifications from friends when they make updates from over 12 hours ago? Fix it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It's ok , sometimes it's Slow if I don't have Internet access	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Sketchy when updates come in...not always notified of post or comments even after updating settings...works just not very well sometimes...fix and you will get 5	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Awsomely great	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia

I'd like to see all my news feed updates, not only from the people FB thinks I should... And the most recent really isn't the most recent or even in order :)	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Still good, but keeps crashing. Please fix	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love keeping in touch on FB!  However, I want a setting to PERMANENTLY see ALL POSTS, and I don't want the business page posts left out.  Want to see everything unless I choose to change the setting.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Great App I love it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like it very much! It's a good way to keep up with family and friends!How ever twitter is better! The people who said they didn't know me are kin folk. But, we have never meet and I would like to get acquainted But! Thanks to FB that will not happen!I didn't like your remarks to me on FB and FB suspending me 7 day is crap and if you want to cancel my account knock your self out.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Like I said before... Stop crashing	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
*uckerburg	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Overall, I like this app.  There are a couple things that could use some work though.  Loading/crashing issues.  Also, it would be awesome if you'd put in landscape view.  Otherwise, I've enjoyed this app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I will scream. Every time I turn around there is a new update.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I love this app since they updated it!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like Facebook all though my old account was compromised I deleted it waited 6 months and started over and it looks like security is getting better!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Not sure why it crashes, probably an iPad glitch. Gets better each update, apart from occasional crash which doesn't impact me at all.Hilariously, it just crashed! Divine intervention?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
So much content that truly want to see and be able to read (really really really really truly, Facebook peeps) is kept from my timeline because of FB's algorithm for feeding content that I feel my world is being censored. Why can't we as individuals decide what we want in our timeline?! Isn't that why you have made that option available to us!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My phone app works so much better!! Would still love to be able to copy and paste directly from the app on my iphone5 -	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like the app but it REALLY IRRITATES ME that every time I share something it TAKES ME BACK TO THE FRIGGIN TOP OF THE BEWS FEED!!!!!! Also it constantly switches my news feed from Mist Recent , WHAT I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO RESET BACK TO, to Top Stories.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Only add a photo in a comment is missing	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashes or freezes constantly since I updated.bloody annoying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love the Facebook app's frequent updates. It's slowly making its way to having everything you need to use Facebook like on a pc. It just hate how it will randomly close when I'm updating my profile or browsing my news feed. Quite annoying.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Previous versions had no issue but after updating to latest version the badge app icon displays 15+ notifications but when i open the app theres nothing new. I reinstalled, rebooted my phone, even logged out and the badge still displays 15+ notifications. Please address this. Thank you.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love Facebook but it freezes all the time, and kicks me out a lot and they are making changes every week. The things they change are things that they just changed the week before. How about fixing the problems before making anymore new stuff. And it is not my service because I have talked to people with other carriers and they are having the same issues.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I get tired of taking the bad with the good!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Every time I try to do anything with typing it fc	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's a great app and a way better version then the rest except it needs to be debugged allot, like deleting the app and re-installing it.Other then that it's an amazing app	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Not too bad but does crash a lot and won't let me scroll to past posts	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I can't believe how slow this app is once it finally opens after crashing repeatedly. When I do get it open, it give me notifications but there is nothing new on my page. After having to scroll through dozens of sponsored ads and suggested pages in my newsfeed the least they could do is make it run better.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I almost never use it anymore because of the landscape issue. I see google+ in my future	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
1.  It's not loading any Most Recent news.2. It won't load comments from others' posts (or it appears to be trying to load but never does). 3.  It CRASHES. 4.  I'd like the option to keep it on NEWSFEED or MOST RECENT when I open it. I know that there are other issues, but these are the most annoying lately. Please fix.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's very handy and user friendly! I love love Facebook on my phone!! Can they make it a lil better??? Yes!! But all in all, I'm very happy!! :) xoxo	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Keep working on it dawgsz	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have never had a problem with this app crashing and every time it updates it is even better. I'm happy with it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes a lot don't like all the extra ads on my page   Would prefer to look at the pages I like instead of every post being put on there.  It's not up to the actual time sometimes post are yesterday and it doesn't catch up.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's keeps closing out.. It's difficult to post and respond to post. I'm really disappointed..	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I enjoy the app an the new features. To me it's the best.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
In the latest update the ability to share a friend's post to a group was removed. The was a feature that was finally added in the last update and now for some reason it has been removed. It was a really useful feature. It is still slow to update and load and closes a lot.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Facebook is the worst. If it wasn't easier to use to connect to people, then I wouldn't use it at all. What's even more annoying is the fact that it keeps asking me to rate it. So here you go Facebook, here's a one star rating because you're the worst. You're welcome!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So the recent update has caused the FB app to crash. Not cool, FB app developers. Not cool.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest update is useless.  App never works properly.  It is perpetually "loading." Please fix!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very slow to load anything. Also crashes a lot. You would think they would try to fix these problems.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So facebook app crash always,i hope you fix it :(	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
New update is Great!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
That is all.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I like it, I can vent on it like get my feelings out. But there are some ppl who just take it to serious lol	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Since new update it is taking forever to load news feed.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Why does FB block me from requesting or accepting people if I don't know them. How do I meet new people if I can't do this?  Please take the block off and stop doing it. If people don't want to accept ones request they don't have too. Thanks, Don	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still need some stuff worked on but other than that its great	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Ughhhh I can't edit events details on the iOS Facebook app. This is frustrating if I needed to do any changes on the go. Plus, the App doesn't allow me to invite new added friends to a previously created events.It Crashes many times over. Doesn't properly enlarge images. It's simply, annoying.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Maravilloso	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This deserves 0. Cant even view pictures. Lags so mug and crashes instantaneously all the time. First it was ok and each update it gets worse you don't even fix the right problems nor the errors. You wanted a stinkin review I have you a stupid review.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps closing, so I have to re-open it everytime. Please fix it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

If I'm chatting with someone and I'm in the middle of writing a message sometimes it'll crash for no reason at all. If I tap on a photo it'll crash, if I try to do just about anything it'll crash about 10 times before working. And even when it finally starts working it'll work as slow as possible. I can't stand this app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

- Trying to delete many (not all) of the "Friends You May Know", but I have to delete one at a time. "Help" is no help on this. I want to see a list and select many at one time for deletion. - The app can't turn off friend's Game notifications. Or at least, I can't find it in the "Help "section. I've hidden Candy Crush for each friend, but I get another notice of an achieved level. I don't care!- The app constantly changed my Wall's Sort button from Most Recent to News Feed, which is Facebook's algorithm of what I will want to read(?). - Where's Landscape mode?- inconsistent Birthday notifications. This app is gets frustrating. If the Mobile site would allow the iPhone to zoom in on pictures, I'd leave this app in a hot second.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It works well over all, but I wish there was a way to organize videos from the app. Also it would be really nice to be able to moe pictures from one album to another. Lastly it would be awesome if there was a way to clear catche and data so it didn't take up so much space.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I get to Facebook after it crashes once or twice.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
App doesn't allow me to sort from recent to top stories or vice versa.    Hardly shows any stories (hundreds of friends and I see the same 20 people).  Shuts down.    Shows a squiggly line and clearly misses stories from last visit.   Oh, and now I get a banner pop up EVERY time asking if I want to know the second someone comments.    No. I don't.  I'm looking through someone's vacation pictures.    Leave me alone!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Frequent freezes and crashes. Doesn't remember settings and takes far too long to get to the "Most Recent" view as it very slowly loads all previous posts in the "News Feed" view first. Slow and unresponsive.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
How can such a big company come out wit an application this terrible. Nothing is up to date. App crashes, you have to close it and restart for it to work; sometimes more than once. And I could keep going with problems. Extremely disappointed.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It takes forever to update the newsfeed. Click on a link or photo, it hangs for a minute before slowly loading. Extremely clunky app. Crashes intermittently and horrendously sluggish speed. It makes me wonder if all the top talent at FB are now elsewhere.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I don't seem to have the problems others do. Maybe it's because I'm on the IPhone.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Update: pressing and holding the keyboard display gives the option to dock or split the keyboard. Docking the keyboard makes it work. The app works fine now. Even my very first issues (deleted) were fixed, so I'm all good. I still appreciate having a Facebook app after not having one for so long. The app is stable for me, but posting and commenting on anything is a pain. The keyboard pops up over the text entry field, so I can't see what I'm typing. The iPhone version works fine. The text field moves up and stays above the keyboard, but it doesn't do that on the iPad.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
You guys need to stop adding these stupid updates like when your in the messaging area you can drag it down that just plain stupid. Also the messages aren't loading fast at all. Way to go you messed that up. Just stop and go back to the original.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I'm not sure about all the updates. I hate that when you share something it automatically resets your news feed to top stories. I keep mine on most recent, if they don't fix it soon I'll just use my computer instead of the app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The app is slow (I'm using a 4S so it's not that old) and the newsfeed is missing updates that should be there (compare with what shows up in a browser on a PC).	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's ALWAYS failure to delete pictures or posts. Please fix.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashing seems frequent. Ads have no trouble loading but when I load a status it won't show me the comments it has notified me about. Every so often I even have to go through an extra screen because there doesn't seem to be a way to click that one doesn't want messenger. Also, the persistent lack of landscape orientation support is irritating. Facebook is really sure of its social media monopoly to be giving their users so much crap.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm not sure why some people are having issues with the update/app. It working perfectly fine on the iPhone 4S	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I use this app more than anything else on my phone. I am definitely what you would call a Facebook addict.  If you are reading this review to see if you should download the app, download it! It's a good app, but like all good apps it has it's flaws. It don't load my notification very fast, but it sends it to my phone quickly. But overall it is a good app, just a little slow!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

It works most of the time, but will get slow and then dump me back to my main desktop on my IPad for no reason. Other times it won't let me type or share a post. The crash and sending me to my home page happens every day now. About 10 or more times. I actually try shutting my iPad off and back on to see if that helps. It's the only app I have issues with on it so I'm thinking FB app needs the help!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Nothing is more frustrating than having to press your home button 5 times just to leave the app. Can't go to my home screen until fb decides it wants to start to update. Opening the app is a challenge in itself! Hit the icon, blank fb screen... App closes on its own... Repeat x3, then fb decides to load. Viewing photos... Don't even think about it! Select a photo to read the details and it either takes its sweet time loading, or the details don't appear for what seems like forever. And the timeline garbage is annoying. I want the old version back; before the timeline. Why is Facebook linked with Instagram?! And who's bright idea was is to get hash tags on fb? It's the dumbest thing you developers have done since fb started. It's annoying to see #hada #funday #atthelake #tanning #withmygirls #drunk #and #dontcare...  Instead of adding hash tags, why couldn't you improve the process of organizing photo albums? Every time I want to move a photo from one album to another, I have to either use my computer or go to the desktop version on my phone. How about editing the friend list? Deleting, changing preferences...A positive to all these recent updates: I can finally delete messages for good rather than only having the option to archive. Though technology and social media are two of the most highly regarded for the majority of the world, can't we keep some of this simple?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Have you guys ever heard of beta testing?  Because it certainly looks like you haven't.  Can't see photos, can't see half my newsfeed, and slow as the second coming of Christ.  If you were my app team, I would fire you guys over this bs you put out.  The version four or five updates ago was great!  Uploads were fast, newsfeed was fast, and you had to go ahead and "Update" an already fine app.  And can you let us have landscape mode for the love of god?  Do not go off those who are giving this app 5 stars, those people are morons.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

UPDATED FOR VERSION 6.2:It still crashes, and it's even slower than before. I have two suggestions for the developers at Facebook:1. Do more thorough regression testing when you add new features. Include some speed benchmarks in the regression testing. And yes, I write software for a living so I know what I'm talking about.2. Forget adding new features. Concentrate on fixing what's wrong first. If the app crashes 2 out of every 3 times I open it, then I don't fscking care about the new features.As it stands now, this app is well on its way to becoming another crippled and useless piece of bloatware.HERE'S THE OLD VERSION 6.1.1 REVIEW:Version 6.1.1, and it seems like all the version 6 releases, are extremely slow to load or to respond to user input. It always starts up in portrait mode and takes several seconds to switch to landscape.Just as bad as the slowness is the fact that it crashes about half the time. Maybe more than half the time. Sometimes it crashes while loading, and sometimes it crashes while in use.The slow performance is NOT related to the WiFi connection or the ISP connection. Rebooting the iPad doesn't help speed it up, either. Previous versions were faster and did not crash as often. Wish I could downgrade or downdate to a previous version.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The newer updated versions of Facebook have been crashing every time I opened the application. Lately I had been ignoring the crashes, but just recently Facebook logged me out of my iPad and iPod. It tells me to log back in on Safari, so I try to login and it requires me to put my mobile phone number for a security check. Problem is:  I know for a fact that I never ever put my mobile phone number anywhere and I definitely didn't give it to Facebook. HOW DO I LOG BACK INTO MY FACEBOOK? It usually let's me skip or ignore the phone number option, but for the security check it says I have to put my phone number in it....but I never did in the past. That makes no sense because it's no longer a security check. They could just send me an email and I could confirm! This might be the last straw. One more majorly upsetting thing that goes wrong with Facebook and I'm done.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Used to be a good app but now takes far too long to both refresh your timeline with other people's updates and upload things to your timeline. Not a network issue a hootsuite works much faster.

I love this app but I I'm so sick of " when you go to look at a photo and zoom in or out" and after a second it goes back to the default size, or the fact that when you go to read what a photo says the the STUPID F@CKING COMMENT THING COVERS IT UP!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

WHY??? Why the last update?!!! It worked perfectly before!! Now it takes several minutes to load and shows only the 2-3 most recent posts then the rest of the timeline are random posts from 2 days ago. It's totally unusable like this! I'm going to twitter.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I want to be able to share posts with GROUPS... Not just friends or in a group chat, but in actual Facebook groups that I'm a member of.

I love it as it keeps me in touch with family	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Get rid of the creepy chat heads, there's no need for them! Fix the news feed loading issues. It's showing items from 24 hours ago and I have it set to most recent. I've reinstalled multiple times and its still doing the same thing. It's an absolutely terrible app. It's worked much better before hand. Add a way to hide posts from people.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app, I love it!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I dislike how often the FB app crashes.I dislike that I cannot change my Cover Photo with the app; I have to go onto the computer.And I also dislike that I cannot edit my comments (or posts) if there is a mistake as I can do on the computer.Furthermore, when it comes to the Page that I Admin, I cannot view the news feed, share pictures from pages I liked, or edit my information with the app. All I can do is update my status or add a picture. If I want to do anything, again, I have to go onto the computer. Fix this.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Absolutely terrible. Crashes and shuts down for no reason, slow to load, freezes, my posts either disappear or it double and triple posts, the message bubble is annoying, and it keeps turning on chat no matter how many times I turn it off. Start fixing the mistakes and stop adding new ones with each update.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
There's a lot of pros and cons when it comes to Facebook.  The majority of them are based on the fact that people who use Facebook live in a fantasy world. The app as a whole is great as long as you use it for what it is... Entertainment.  I feel the only thing missing is that "dislike" button.  Aside from that its great.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Both the Facebook app and Facebook messenger app stink. They both keep crashing, freezing and it takes forever to show you a picture someone has sent over message. It only shows you half a message.

Perhaps it's time for FB to close. App crashes. Automatically changes privacy settings. Get involved too much in all sorts of games. Too much advertisement that offends me even after I took steps to tell FB it offends me and my believes. Get your act together! New update is toooo slow! Does not update the page at all!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Facebook is basically a utility. Everyone uses it all the time. It's a behemoth. Yet somehow, nobody over there can manage to come up with an app that isn't bug-filled and frustrating. There is no excuse.  Every time there's an update, it's worse.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I have been using the facebook app for some time now and frequently it crashes on me. It's not that I do many things at a time on the app (I mean, you can only really do one thing at a time) and I even go to my own home page whilst messaging so it doesn't constantly refresh the newsfeed. However, it still constantly black-screens and shuts down. I also noticed that for photo uploading from an iphone it is rather easy. You click on the photo icon and click your desired photos. For an ipad it is much more difficult. You click on the icon, go to the folder, click the photo and have to do that every time for every individual photo. I wish they would update the ipad one to be more convenient.Hope this helped.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I installed it before and it was fine, until i decided i didn't need it and deleted it.

What?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I enjoy using Facebook & find it easy to use. At times Facebook shuts down & is slow, but it is really nice to stay in contact with friends & family. Lately I've found that Facebook is taking forever to update. It's been worse than ever. I'm still glad to be able to stay in contact with friends and all my family. Face book has been really slow lately.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I think the Facebook app works FANTASTIC I've NEVER had it crash on my iPhone 5 thank you so much for all you guys do to give us the best experience possible	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Never opens without crashing.  gives me notifications whenever people update their status or upload a picture, even if I'm not tagged. Always defaults to top stories, not most recent.  New messaging bubble is annoying.  The new story bubble when scrolling down is intrusive, distracting and completely unnecessary.  Too many suggested posts and game requests.  Convinced me to delete Facebook.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seriously why are you guys so hellbent on the top stories sorting? It shouldn't be that hard to program it to actually remember that I want most recent. Lazy!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Loading the feed and comments on a specific status became very slow with this latest update!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I use the Facebook app for iPad everyday. I'm grateful for it, and it has evolved. Previously, you couldn't tag photos or posts, and you couldn't share links. Now you can, but you are limited. For instance, you can't share a link on someone else's page. I hate that I am inundated with ads right in my feed that I cannot remove. These are not ads for pages I've liked, but random businesses. Also, this app crashes a fair amount, and sometimes it is so slow it's ridiculous. I belonged to a group, and whenever I tried to read posts on the group page or post to it, it would freeze or crash or take forever just to load the page.  There are still things you can't do in here, so sometimes I have to log in on my desktop computer. There's clearly some improvement still needed.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Ok	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Every time you update this app, it crashes more and more. Is it too much to ask that I am able to open it the first time?!?! So annoying. FIX IT. I've been dealing with this since your last update.NOW IT WON'T EVEN UPDATE!! It's just sitting on my screen acting like it's updating. Has been that way for at least 3 days. And yes, my phone memory is fine. Can't access FB from the app at all now. WORTHLESS!! If there was a rating for 0 stars I would choose that.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like to get on Facebook by iPod. But there's lots of updates and my iPod freezes while going through news feeds. And my iPod freezes sometimes while looking at photos so I have to exit out of it and go back.. :(	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It's a part of life now, one of the greatest and most damaging inventions ever	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Takes forever to load the newsfeed or when I get a reply and try to check it. They don't show up. Can't really do stuff that you could on the web version (not PC, actually typing in Facebook.com on phone).Overall a decent app. Although they keep making it more and more annoying. That message bubble crap is stupid. I miss having "favorites".	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After opening and viewing a link in a post, when you hit the back arrow, it does not take you back to the post. It takes you back to the top of the very first post listed. I don't like the circle message icon, annoyingly in the way until you drag it gone  Bad upgrade!!!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

For second time in four updates have had to delete and reinstall app. Don't you test upgrades? Gets stuck in refresh forever. If next reload works, am ignoring all other update prompts	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The app is not quite as functional as the online browser but that's to be expected. The iPhone app, however, presents a real issue for logging off. To log back on, you just need to tap "Continue" and off you go, there is no option I've been able to locate should you wish to truly log off. Should you by mischance lose your iPhone ANYONE AT ALL can just tap that button and proceed to mess with your contacts, settings, etc. with no problem at all. I do NOT like this setup at all.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Another update, and I STILL can't view comments posted by others on pages I have "liked", what's the point? Can't stand those "Chat Bubbles", and I'm getting REAL sick of having to select "Most Recent" EVERY single time I use the app!!!Hate it. To hell with this useless app, I'll just log on to the desktop version from now on!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Typing status updates, comments, etc. in portrait mode is such a pain. Nearly every app that requires typing lets us turn the iPhone and type in landscape mode with a wider keyboard. Every update of this app that does not fix this problem is an insult to iPhone users.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love it	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Just when I thought the Facebook app was getting better, I updated to the latest version today and it keeps crashing every few seconds. Also, it keeps showing I have 10 or so new notifications, yet when I open the app, there are only 2 or 3. Please fix, it's unusable as is.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
did the update today and now my app disappeared and when I try to go to get it at the App Store, it shows "open" instead of "install", but it won't open!! wth??!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app works perfectly fine on my iPhone 4. I don't know why it doesn't work for some people. Although I would say that the app is significantly slower than its predecessor, version 6.1. But anyhow, the app works flawlessly on my iPhone 4. A few improvements and bug fixes would get it up to a 5 star application.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
What on earth have you done to my news feed?! I want to see everything, not what you decide to show. Also it's not in time/date order! This makes no sense. Very poor.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

It's a pretty good app really...but every time it updates I'm waiting for one little detail that is on the main site but not the app. That is, the ability to hide a status or other post from specific people. Not by "friend groups" or whatever but by choosing the person from all of your friends and clicking that they cannot see the post. Give us this and I'll be 5 star happy.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It always shuts down	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The net version of this app crashes way too much, mostly when I'm viewing messages. Also, please make an improvement where it scrolls down the post for you when you have a new comment on a long post. I'm tired of scrolling down to look at it every time. More improvement, less crap, please.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The app is no longer useable after this last update. The whole screen now had a red grid over it and i can't see he screen at all. FIX IT!Do you actually read these reviews? None of the problems I've reported have been fixed yet and it's still got bugs I reported over 2 years ago. 1 star review and I doubt I'll raise it after none of the bugs getting fixed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Still crashes at various random times after the latest update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
the app probably crashes the for iPhone 5 every 5 minutes	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can no longer see up to date news feed and status updates from friends, just the ones from the day before. So basically facebook is now a day behind.  Wow what a pants update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
In my opinion, the app itself is easy to navigate however it is the SLOWEST app ever and crashes frequently. I rarely use it because it's a hassle & takes forever.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Won't even update! Asking me for email address and password I don't have!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I'm extremely disappointed with the new Facebook . It's always crashing, you should start by fixing what is wrong with the app rather than adding new features .	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Great app, would be better if you could use # and @ symbols to hi light words or links. Can only do this on laptop.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Update draining battery this happens all the time please release a fix	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
After the new update it loads and works so much faster. No crashing now (so far). I really like the new messaging feature!I still don't like having to select MOST RECENT every time I open Facebook. Anyway to automatically set this would be good. Overall I'm glad for the improvements. Before the most recent update this app was a nightmare.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This is a horrible app. I've had it for a while on my iPad 3, about almost a year and it's always crashing, freezing or just locking up. The only reason I keep it is for convenience but you would think since Facebook is so popular they'd fix it. Get this app only for convenience but it really is a pain in the neck.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Well Facebook has done it again! The sent out an update that screwed things up. It takes ages for thing to load (if it ever does), can't see comments, and it keeps changing away from most recent (my preference).

I think it was the last update. My phone crashes everytime it's loading Facebook on my phone. If you could fix that I'd be most grateful. I don't know why people have to get so angry about this stuff, sheesh, it's just Facebook.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This update appears to have solved the crashing issue on iPhone 4. Loading times need to improve though. It shouldn't take 20-30 seconds to load a few simple lines of text over a fast broadband connection.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Facebook was actually working!!! It wasn't a great app but for the first time in a solid year it worked ok, then the update, it stalled out and "paused" trying to load for 12 hrs, on an iPhone 5 LTE no less, I give up app deleted, what a piece of crap as always I can't wrap my brain around the idea that ppl get paid for this!!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Updated the app last night on iPhone 5 and iPad and do not have any of the new features. Have deleted and reinstalled app but no difference. Friend has all the new features. Wtf?!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The most recent update won't even allow the app to load anymore. It might benefit to stop enhancing fancy features and make sure the app itself actually works.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Sick of not being able to see photo albums on pages. I don't always have the opportunity to use a PC so that I can view the albums through your main sight.

I don't know why people are complaining but this app works fine with me. I have the iPhone 5 running 6.1.2 .

I don't see the need of updating, worst than previous update. App crashing is the biggest issue, after the new update the app crash count increase to 10x the amount of crash count from previous update. The new update sometimes does not gives you alert/ notification when someone messaged you, but when it does, it notify you twice which is really annoying. Seriously‰Û_if you guys make another update, can you please test it first before releasing it?I know it's hard but please make a new update and fix it. Thank you	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It crashes several times a day. Not only that it for some reason zooms partway in on pictures and doesn't let you stay zoomed out to see the whole picture, cutting off words of text. It freezes up often and has a lot of lag. I keep hoping that the constant updates available for it will do something, but no changes ever noticeable.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm about fed up with this app. Ever since my wife and I updated our apps this week, we haven't been able to update our newsfeed.

Every time I am going through the feed, I have shared several things and I am pretty far deep going through my friends statuses FB decides to send me back to the top of the feed to start all over again.

Just one time I'd like to see an update that actually makes this app better. It crashes all the time, very slow, still no landscape mode, you can't keep it at most recent (even though posts should be in chronological order anyway) and most recent since the "update" goes from an hour ago to a post that posted yesterday morning...I could go on, but really what's the point, the developers clearly don't care and ignore users comments anyway.

Overall, a well functioning app. However, functioning means adequate, not exceptional. 2 stars lost for things that we currently don't have, this is only off the top of my head so there are probably a few other minor things, but firstly, could you possibly fix the Most Recent option for the newsfeed, as it seems to not work often. Secondly, I would like to politely request that there be an option to disable the chat heads, or if there already is, perhaps to make it more easily accessible. They are slowing all of my devices down unnecessarily, and I never wanted this. They're incredibly aggravating. While I would expect that some people think its cool, and probably use it and love it, I would like the option to not have to deal with them if all they're causing me is angst.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

Generally the app is really good and does everything you want but there are a few problems they need to fix: when you try to edit privacy setting the app crashes, looking at photos zooms in slightly and cuts off the edge of photos. And one of the groups that should come up below 'nearby' has disappeared.  Still shows up on the mobile Internet site but not on the app. But overall I would still download the app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

I like the app, but version 6.2 awful! The biggest problem with it is 'loading.' Whether it be a picture, comments, locations, etc...I have to shut down the app and reopen it, and often that doesn't even work. Sometimes you're just out of luck.Also, like several others I'm sure, the inability to use landscape mode drives me nuts! It may have passed in the 90's, but most of us have smartphones. One of the advantages to having a smartphone is being able to flip your phone sideways and send messages quickly. This app currently forces painstaking, single finger comments and statuses.Fix those issues and I bet a lot of people will be much happier with the app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
this app still crashes to much and locks up a lot also!!! you really need to fix this bug in notifications it says I have 32,45,66,93,99 new notifications and I have either 1 or none!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

When I first got the app a year ago it ran pretty smoothly, and that was on my third gen iPod touch. Every time I download an update the app crashes on the first launch, and I use the fifth gen now. I recommend that a new app must be made from the ground up, because the app seems to become less and less responsive with each update. I'm tired of having to deal with the app crashing when I go to view a picture! A bug when scrolling through timelines needs to be fixed because when I scroll to the top it thinks that I scrolled to update when it is apparent that I didn't and it takes forever to do so! Also when I open up and check every one of my notifications it still says that I have some and it will tell me that I have 10 notifications when I have 2! Still no landscape. Lazy! It was there when I had my third gen! Then you take it out? What the hell are you thinking?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It keeps crashing and it's soooooo slow!!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I have the same prob as everybody else you have to open and then re-open the app, then when you want to update a pic it crashes and they should start creating a unlike button but from there i have no prob	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Very easy to use. Very convenient.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Fix it. This is unacceptable how poorly the app runs. Why can't you use the app to upload pics to albums? What a pain! Why does my phone show notifications but it never loads on the app once opened. Y'all have BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. This app should work 100% of the time. Not 10%.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If Facebook doesn't stop closing itself while I'm typing a message, deleting all of the text,  it's getting uninstalled!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Welcome to Crashbook where it's not a good as the website and  it crashes every 2 seconds.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sometimes you'll do an update and its perfect, but then you'll do another that buggers it up and then another where you don't even fix the problem. It takes too long to load newsfeeds. It messes about with most recent, then misses a chunk.. You have to keep pressing most recent/newsfeeds till comes up properly and only after all that will you be able to see your notifications. Please sort this.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Easy to use. Works great on iphone 5.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
It's ok, needs work to make the news default as most recent. A better way to Facebook is to use safari it rarely crashes like the bug ridden app when trying to comment, or fetch newsfeed when it just hangs there and does nothing	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
When I scroll I start to read something and it goes back to the beginning every time! Turns its self off ! Not easy enough sometimes, can't find people cause it never loads ! Etc	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I hate when it shows in the chat the time when people have been online..	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Newsfeed now doesn't update on my phone (iPhone 5). Was previously 'always on' but there's no point anymore, will revert to just glancing at it if I happen to have a spare few minutes on a laptop. Please fix - looking at the recent reviews, I'm not the only one to have had this issue.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

When trying to open Facebook app on phone it shows it's loading then kicks you out so you have to press twice, which is annoying just to get in, only started happening since 2nd last update please get it sorted out.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
When I tried to update the app it says that it's installing but does nothing and now I can't even get onto it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Crash, slow, anything along those lines will definitely sum up this app. Just make it simple, Jesus Christ ..	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
What's good:- i like the additional features, including the cleaner news feed, more options of sharing from the news feed, and the newest feature of adding emoticons or posting activity within your status.- so far, the app has run decently with very few crashes- the new messenger features are nice and fun- i'm not sure what the others are complaining about with the lack of landscape mode; on the iPad, i utilize landscape mode primarily and the app still responds to that, for me.What's bad:- the events part of the app has a lagging glitch, making it impossible to not like and comment on each post in a new window nor to wait an extra five minutes during every two minutes for the page to load/respond. The most recent update did not fix this, and this does need to get fixed -- soon!- COPY AND PASTE needs to be available for when we share statuses with links attached (as well as for posts in general, just in case it's needed) or the statuses need to just be wholly shared -- post, link and all. How bout just make both options available?- despite the additional sharing options in the newsfeed, the options for sharing from a post or photo directly separate from the news feed are still limited. If there are more options from sharing directly within the news feed, all of those same options need to be available in every instance that sharing is available throughout the app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Every time I send a message to someone it crashes and shuts down. It does this multiple times a day and is very annoying!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
It's a really good app would definitely recommend it to people, the only thing that I would change is when it shows when someone is online (to actually show it) and when they were last online as I have to look at my 'Facebook Messenger' to see when someone was last online. I would also change when your looking at a full screen picture (viewed by your phone iPad iPod or whatever) to stop it zooming itself in cutting out the edges of the photo. Other than that its a brill app and would definitely recommend it to people.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

I don't like all the new buttons for the news feed. Acquaintances, most recent, all friends. It's stupid. I click most recent and it gives me feed from the day before or 4 hours ago its all messed up. I like the old one where it was top stories or most recent. Not that difficult. No need the change something that isn't broken. I hate having to go to everyone's page to see what's going on instead of scrolling through the news feed because its all messed up now.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Facebook updates twice a month at times and every time it gets worse, the latest update has been a joke, Now it no longer crashes randomly, it freezes and takes ages to load,When uploading pictures , you will have to close it after 30, once you try and upload 60 the app crashes and losses all the pictures you where updating.The newsfeed is the worst part of the app, the newsfeed Dosnt have the latest comments or status , it pulls ones from the day before and when you scroll down to update , it just gives the time bar for over 10 minutes.Facebook app needs new creators soon. Or release a new app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Everyone seems to have serious problems with this app, and I can't figure out why. Yes, it takes awhile to load sometimes, but if anything your data network or wifi are to blame for that. If it "crashes" and force-closes, it's probably the phone to blame, not being able to handle the massive amount of data incoming. Chill, y'all. It's Facebook. On your phone. Works just fine for me!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Is good but needs a few minor errors fixed on it than it would be the best Facebook app update ever!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
copy & paste option would be awesome!!! The ability to copy and paste words, that don't allow you to share would be awesome!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Due to its slow loading and freezing, its horrible.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Only one star until the app is fixed. Why can't I go to a fan page and see what people are writing on their wall anymore?? Very frustrating!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Easy to use and easy to install. Would recommend !	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
When a post is selected to view comments, they don't load.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's an app, that runs Facebook, what more do you need to know?Still need a better way of deleting messages when used with an iPhone, iPod or iPhone (assuming its the same on others). Having to delete them one bit at a time is annoying. Fix that and you get that last star..	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Very user friendly and much less confusing than the full Facebook site. I like chat heads a lot- very easy to navigate between conversations and my newsfeed. Would give 5 stars but the crashes happen much too frequently- at least several times per day. Knocked off 2 stars for constant crashing and slowness of loading.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
G	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like it great way to keep up with friends and family	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Just awful. Takes forever to load anything, even with full reception and full wifi. News feed doesn't ever even update. The developers clearly didn't and still don't care about this app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app crashes on me 24/7. I don't know whether its my phone or not - it does the same for friends so I assume not - but could you please fix these bugs.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Liking the new features. If you can just add the feature where I can type with the phone horizontal off be perfect!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I dont like it that you have to type one way wish u guys made it to where we can type sideways please make the app go sideways	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app stinks. Crashes often, takes forever to load. They can't sell ads like the desktop version so they will never improve it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
No complaints	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I've skipped the "update your information" sections probably 15 times now but it keeps showing up. Why in God's name would anyone be stupid enough to actually list their address, phone number , or any other private information like that if it weren't a business? Please stop asking.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The latest upgrade is very poor, did anyone actually test it before it went out?? It is so slow to update it is painful to the point it is not worth having it. Very poor performance and the I phone 5 notification glitch has still not been fixed!! Seriously thinking of ditching FB altogether	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Love FB  I get to keep up with family!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Would get a higher rating if I could zoom and rotate content.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Whatever the new update was, is terrible. App is completely useless in my iPhone 5. Please fix!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works well. Nice interface for FB. I don't understand what all the complaints are about. Always works perfectly	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app go to home every second!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Minus one minor crash that required a log out/in, having no problems with the Facebook app on my iPhone.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Mes quand j'ai des bulle de conversation je peux pas les avoir dans mon Ì©cran daceuille ?	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
my favorite app. thanks	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Freezing and crashing more than normal.  HELP!!!!   The news feed is all backwards.  Oldest 1st then newest last.  UGHHHHJ	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
USELESS!  This is my third review of Facebook upgrades. With each "improvement" things keep getting worse. I can no longer use FB on my phone as it crashes 3 or more times opening it or using it. I am unable to scroll without being sent back to the start repeatedly and I am seeing 4to 6 copies of each post. I am unable to post any comments at all. It is a totally useless app for iPhone. Very disappointed.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This Facebook works well on my phone . Haven't has any trouble .	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app always crashes. You made an update i updated it but still. FIX IT!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App always crashes when I open it, and if it doesn't crash, it doesn't update. Also needs new Facebook desktop updates such as picture comments and hashtags.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app is bloody well made, I don't think people are giving FB enough credit for their work.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It's just the most amazing and spectacular app I have ever seen!!!My life is complete forever!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Love this app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Only really use it when out and about and works fine for me	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Love it after finally got the update to do the feeling , watching etc statues :)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
I can't scroll in the app. All the top buttons (Notification, Message, and Friend Request) work, but nothing below that registers that I am touching the screen. I have tried rebooting my 4s, completely closing and reopening, and even deleting and redownloading the app. Would love a fix, k thx bai.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It does what it needs to do. My least favorite new feature is the little head bubbles that pop onto the screen when you get a message. But I can live with it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
FB for iPhone suffers crashes, just closes without warning, A LOT!  Can't type in landscape mode, which is annoying as heck.  In fact, I couldn't even open this review the first time, it just closed on me and I had to reopen. There are just enough bad things to ruin the good things.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Really unimpressed with the updated app. It still doesn't load all the news stories on the newsfeed plus I find it really annoying that I have to always specify I want the most recent stories rather than the default setting where Facebook decides on which stories take priority. It also seems slower so it's definitely not an improvement on the last version. What's particularly annoying though is the fact that it sometimes shows the updates from the last 20 minutes or so then misses out the next 12 hours to take you back to updates you saw the previous day! Please sort it out... it's REALLY irritating!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Hands down the worst functioning app I have. But I'll keep using it bc how else can I feed my FB addiction? Ugh.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It works just fine for me. I enjoy the convenience of being able to keep in touch & upload pictures right in my hands.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Millions use it daily and you still want me to rate it? And how often? This has been rated by me several times now. It's a ball ache. All the recent changes, constant privacy setting alterations. It used to work fine until you 'fixed' it. It crashes regularly, and tapping on a photo stalls it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Best ever!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Cons:  Push notification still not working.  Ads taking up the whole screen.  Crashes unexpectedly.  Use some of your new stock money to fix this stuff already.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So easy to use! Everything is at your finger tips. Chat bubbles rock!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
i find it to be a great app works perfect on my iphone 5 :)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Just updated and keeps coming up with an error.  Tried reinstalling not working.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hate the update	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
No worky after latest update.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
A huge improvement 	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Thanks for the power of networking!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Ok	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Really dig the new cover photo change!! Been waitin on that forever! The chat bubbles are ok, sometimes annoying. Sometimes it does crash and you'll have to restart it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
there are times when facebook is always behind several hours and is always crashing..wish we could get away from all the advertising too!! could be better	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This version works great!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
this has to be the most ridiculous app, I realise that it has updates and that it has a lot it has to do, all apps have limitations but when I had to update as my old app crashed, this one doesn't give me notifications, thinks that I do have the authority to delete my own posts or thinks that a single letter on a notification on a comment cant be posted as it has been flagged as spam or offensive! what are you all doing?	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Fantastic app !!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
My favorite app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Why change it so much? It was fine how it was. It's just annoying now.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
You can't copy and paste and thats what's bugging me !!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
It's prone to crashing, but most times it's usable.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great App! Small changes here and there are great! Constantly making the app better!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I think the mobile app is good, but should have ability to copy and paste, etc...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Out of all the apps on my phone this I'd the only one that never works. It crashes every time I open it!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I don't like how this app constantly locks up. Always have to close it out and reopen it. No other app is this bad.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Needed to just update this app on my iPhone 4 and I've tried several times to update with no luck, and even deleted and re-installed the app several times with zero success as it just does nothing now even after turning the phone off and re-starting the phone it seems to just not want to download this app. Very frustrated!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This has got be the best Facebook ever. Plus it's stupid gay	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Fix so that when you look up a friend it starts where you left off and not at the beginning.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love the new feature where the app just doesn't work I think it's just great! 0  outa 10	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nice interface and they release new things very often. Kind of annoying sometimes. Although it crashes from time to time still it's better then the browser one.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This app is awesome font ever delete this app i f**** love it ‰_	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Was working great updated now it randomly shuts down alot.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate how you can't approve tags.. And it keeps asking for personal info.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
JUST LOVE FACEBOOK FOR IPHONE IS THE BEST! ;)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
And i don't have the status mood 	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Fast, easy to use great app :)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
J'aimerai que sur l'iPhone ont puisse mettre le iPhone de cÌ«tÌ© pour envoyer un message ou sur le tchatte .. Sa bogue beaucoup souvent tout ferme sans aucune raison ...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Great app, easy to use, stable on iPhone. Next best thing to the laptop version.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
One more thing...not impressed with the bubble Message. No longer do I get an icon notification when I have a new message waiting. I'd much rather open messages thru the left side menu or top icon, like it used to be. I do however much appreciate the option to slide your finger over the message now to archive or delete instead of having to go thru safari to do this.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Esta actualisacion lo unico bueno son las burbujas del chat pero toda la aplicacion esta horrible para todo! Todo se tarda en cargar, los mensajes no se envian o no llegan completos o simplemente no llegan! Tarda en cargar me salgo 5 segundo de la app y ya se pone en blanco y tengo que esperar aque carge! PORFAVOR ARREGLEN TODO ESO POR QUE ES UN FASTIDIO TENER QUE ESTAR PASANDO POR TODO ESO! Nose que les paso antes eran chevere facebook! AGANA ALGO! :@@	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Don't like the fact that people that you don't know can see your post when you post on a friend's wall.There should be an option to clear all your wall in a simple step not comment by comment..	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I like the app, but I'm always amazed at what I'm missing on my mobile version compared to the computer version.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I always have to delete the app and re-install it because it won't ever load.Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.I'd give it half of one star if I could.Fix it PLEASE!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is AWESOME!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
So far the update is pretty neat. I'm digging the use of the thumbs up in the private message, too.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I hate this App. It crashes, stalls out, and jumps around (making you hit things you didn't want to hit) I really hate posting pictures with my iPhone due to the fact that old comments from other pictures are still on there, they don't go away with each new posting! I also don't like how your friends post are not all in order.  You might have several from four hours ago mixed with ones from a minute ago! I hate that!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm very sad with this last update, my feed of notices stay out od my iphone. The last version is more efetive and beautiful.  Please! Change this!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Upgrade works good. No real issues.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
What a great way to stay in touch with family and friends. I like to share pictures and other activities I do. Thank you	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Garbage, it's crashing. Please fix it. Garbage!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just want the friends lists to be back on the side instead of at the top-- separate from news feed.  I would also be able to use custom share on the iPhone so I can choose multiple friends lists to share with instead of just one.  I hate the iphone app.  Please make it easier to navigate news feed and friends' lists!  My time on FB has decreased significantly. If it isn't improved,  I've even thought about taking many friends out of lists. I do not like how the news feed has to be scrolled down every time and then scrolled back up to change my friends list. My friends lists have been rearranged so I can't find them anymore.  I had everything organized and now it's chaos.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's good but it can be better .. Needs help with video upload and that's just about it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Nice	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This would be a great app if it didn't crash so much. I'm usually messaging someone when it crashes.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I truly appreciate Facebook! With my children moving out into their own lives, it makes me feel like I'm still connected. With family and friends living in different parts of the country, we still get to share our lives. When the younger generation needs help, they tend to reach put through Facebook, even a lot of adults.  I truly thank God for Facebook!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Enough said !	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's good, but don't enjoy the slowness and when the app closes on itself. Once those bugs are fixed it will be great.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I love the mobile Facebook! I'm on this several times a day 7 days a week. Although it has crashed on me a couple of times I still gave it 5 stars for a fun, interactive and easy to use app!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The features are nice, but it crashes too much on iPhone!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
this is a good appbut it crashes when I tap on photos, when I try to get out of photos, when I check my inbox, when I refresh, when I close the app and go back in and just about any other time that I do anything with photosso it would be a good app if I could use it without it crashing	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Not bad	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
One word: addicted!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can you update all ,and can you fix the bugs o and you can't change the timeline pic ,on the app ?	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

I love using Facebook on my ipad , its great. The pictures and videos are so beautiful and I can upload my stuff anywhere with my traveling wifi thingy.... Lol. I will be posting many more pictures and videos to share with all my family and friends.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still crashes as and when it wants too, plus groups scroll to the top when something new gets posted which is annoying when your catching up on older posts	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
FB is a good app to keep in touch with old school buddies, work buddies, and family and friends, BUT to me it still invades your privacy way too much!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I love Facebook it's good!! But the Facebook app should have video chatting!! That'd amazing, keep it up Facebook crew.  From: Ashlyn,	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Tired of asking to rate. Facebook has gone down hill. needs new management. Zuckersuck	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
We need the edit button for the fb iPhone app, we need it to be more like the Pc version, compared to the real version and app there is a lot different and it needs to be fixed.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Don't bother updating to the latest version. Updating timeline takes and age and has bugs when sorting by most recent. Facebook you should not send this type of release live until fully user tested. Shame on you all as such a huge global operation that currently is not operating as it should.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It would be nice to add landscape orientation to the iPhone and iPod touch...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

My way of reaching out to my friends with no effort! Still loved it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app seems to still be in its infant stage. It glitches. It's slow. You still must go to the pc to make some changes. I made sure it wasn't a router issue. I still use it a lot because its so popular with friends and family. I'm sure things will get better.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Does not work correctly. Can't see pictures and does load correctly. Keeps getting locked up.  Just going to the web for Facebook .  Please fix the bugs!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If Facebook mobile offered an unfollow post option and fix the bug crashes of late I could see giving it 5 stars.  But since its not an option Facebook gets 3 stars	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love it but it takes to long to load and sometimes I have to re open it to actually be able to use it.. And it also closes unexpectedly.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
WORST app! With every update it gets worse. Crashes constantly, painfully slow, news stream won't update at all now, pictures don't come into view. I'm totally disgusted.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Fan pages layout is horrible. Can't go thru albums. Why is the timeline on a separate page? And can't view posts by others on the pages. I work with a lot of people in the cosplay industry and like having access to these kinds of things. 1 star til it's fixed. And now I can't share pictures to friends walls.

This last update has not been a good one. Prior to the update my app worked beautifully. Now comments on a post don't load the little wheel just spins and spins. I have a 4s. Did you leave us in the dust? I hope you can fix it. This is not okay.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Get with it facebook, Updates are supposed to be "better" I've had more freezes and crashes now more than EVER!! Continuous crashes every single day.. This is so rediculous...

Quelque bug !!! Crash	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
The other half of the time it freezes, shuts down, won't update or post comments, statuses, etc. it's a crapshoot. My favorite is when I try to add pictures and it shuts the whole app down and I have to start over. Good times.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
‰Û¢ Crashes way too much. ‰Û¢ I'll be reading updates & FB will refresh with more updates & will automatically scroll very very fast to the top of the updates. Now I've list the place where I was reading & have to find it again. Very annoying.‰Û¢ Slow, very slow to respond.‰Û¢ Will not allow copy & paste of text on a iPhone.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Overall, it's not  bad. The chat feature sometimes goes a bit overboard, as it will notify you in the chat box and still send you push notifications.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Like the new emoticons for status updates	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app crashes a lot. Everything, updates to the wall or homepage, trying to scroll, post, seems to take forever to load. Inboxes, you try to scroll the messages and the messages disappear!! You try to scroll a little more and it comes back. It's annoying. Also, I like to inbox things to myself that I don't want to lose. I can't do that from the app. I have to go to my computer. There should be a folder or something like the photo section that can be added so we can "Snag" things we don't want to lose on our walls and not have to inbox ourselves.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I think what could make this app better would be if you were able to change your profile picture/cover photo without having to upload the picture on to an album. With the desktop version, you are able to do so just from your computers storage, so would there be anyway just to take a picture from your library/camera roll and directly put it as your profile picture/cover photo, rather than having a duplicate of it on another album? Thanks :) oh and PLEASE stop making half my messages dissapear. And push notifications don't work.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Seems to loop all the time since the last update.  Have to exit and re-enter, since the pull-down "update" doesn't usually do the trick.Plus, I keep getting page suggestions from facebook for crap I'd never be interested in or find useful.  What kind of crack-smoking monkeys are working in the  marketing department these days?Updated review:  The mobil facebook application is better than nothing, but only barely.The list of things that can't be done on mobil compared to on a computer is way too long to even start.  Still being bombarded with ads and page suggestions for crap that I'd NEVER be interested.The app seems to get even worse with each "update".If not for my friends on facebook, I'd bail.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not thrilled that you are forcing users to update. My Facebook icon disappeared and it would not come back on until I updated the app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

This is the worst update I have ever seen, ever since I did the update when scrolling through my news feed, the feed stops and will not go any further, the little circle thinking symbol is displayed and never goes away. The only way to remedy it is to completely close the app out and restart it resulting in your news feed starting all over again thus you never get to see the entire feed as this happens after looking at 10-30 posts. Also when receiving a notification, you click on it and it takes you to the page but no comments are displayed, instead all you see is the stupid thinking circle, this also happens in every group I am a part of. Seeing how I only use my iPhone to access FB if this problem isn't remedied quickly I will be forced to delete my Facebook account all together. Here's son advice Facebook, do not reset the news feed when the app is closed out, give that option to the user........	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Personally it's been or has been a very good. It may load a bit slow at times but has come a long way & has been heading towards a good direction	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook is fine for iPhone, however, it crashes... A lot! Mostly when I'm trying to send an inbox it will crash and I will lose the whole message, it's very annoying. I like the "feeling..."

This most recent update is horrible. There's no such thing as multi-tasking with this app. Exit it and try to go back only causes it to freeze and close itself out. What makes it worse is how slow the app is when it actually works.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I like the app, but in my opinion, there's a few changes that should happen. First off, I don't like the whole 'top stories' business. It should just update to what was most recently posted, not what you think is popular. Another thing is, we should be able to delete posts from this app. I find that I want to delete posts somewhat often, and I believe that I should be able to without going somewhere and borrowing a computer. Also, I have a suggestion. I believe that you should have a choice to see who has seen your profile, and how often they have visited it. Another suggestion is that we should be able to select a certain few people and get notifications when they get online. I believe that Facebook is doing pretty well, but those are my suggestions.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

After using every version since the first release FaceBook still can't get it right. For once, and last, people want "Most Recent" posts listed first. I'm am absolutely sick of having to keep selecting sort by "MOST RECENT" after every post, launch or use. (And don't even think about sticking the option in some obscure settings menu). We want to see in chronological order what is new, not a damned hodgepodge of posts all mixed up for the last week. Good god man!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The new update makes me not even want to use Facebook anymore, it shuts down all the time, everytime you share a post it resets your timeline on top of the fact that it doesn't stay on the timeline option I choose. If I pick most recent it should stay there until I change it, that's why I chose it. If I wanted to go back to the top I would click new stories, I did not therefore I want to stay where I was when I shared the post. I don't want the app to dictate what I see I should be dictating the app what I want it to show me.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

...with the way in which the app is functioning at present. It crashes frequently; pictures don't load properly, or cause the app to crash; comments that I've received notifications for fail to make an appearance on my photos. These issues are not acceptable, and do not exemplify your abilities as application developers. Either you aren't as skilled as you need to be, or you have become sloppy, and are not thoroughly testing your product before releasing it to the public.

In the iPhone Its a krazie and in the computer Its BETTER ITS amezing so cool YEAAA	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Takes for ever to open and when it does it's closes faster then it opened. I can't even play games with friends because the new update won't allow Facebook to open to sign in. This is ridiculous it shouldn't be that hard to play games with family and friends!! Yall need to fix it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This version of the app is absolute crap the app will not start most of the time and when it does you can basically do nothing. It needs an update but until then is just wasting space on my device	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is being dumb I don't have it on my home screen on my iPod and when I go to the App Store it says open and I click it and nothing happens	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If you need to have your iPhone randomly reboot on you, this is your app. If you've ever had the inconvenience of having to hold down a button for a few seconds to reboot, worry no more! Simply tagging people in a photo at the stroke of midnight will be enough to cause your iPhone to go bananas with Facebook, causing a sudden reboot. Enjoy!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I love the additions when we update it. Sometimes it crashes, but overall, it is very good.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I like the idea of the emoticons, if they just left it at that....but there is the smiley face emoticon and then it's added "feeling happy" included in your post. Dumb, isn't that what the emoticon is supposed to convey? Leave the emoticons, just leave the "descriptive text" that explains it out of the picture....	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I have been using apple apps for over 4 years and have never left a review on anything, but I am so frustrated with the Facebook app. If you are like me, you don't use a laptop anymore, you stick to your phone for Facebook and quick Internet searches but I have had to resort to pulling out my old pc because the Facebook app is so slow. It crashes multiple times a day and now it is doubling all the posts on my newsfeed and not allowing me to click through a post to "continue reading". Please fix the problems. It should not be that difficult to come up with a program that works. Even if it is more simple than the version that is now in use... Which isn't usable...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Every time I want to use the app I have to open stare at a white screen wait for it to crash and then reopen it! Once I'm on FB everything loads so slow. I usually regret trying to see comments or a full picture! On the plus side pictures usually upload fast and I like the new chat!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great app!!!! Love it!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
#Facebook removed my business page "Instant Assistant Social Media Services"  I had developed and spent intensive time building/developing based on a false claim from a woman claiming all rights to the word "Instant Assistant".  I contacted the woman directly and she was a vicious unbalanced loon that never let me even speak let alone find out why she would troll around FB shutting down people's pages with those words in the title.  I contacted FB several times via requests and complaints to 0 response or assistance from FB.  I want my original content returned to me, yet no response from Facebook.   This woman boasts proudly on her page at "Instant Assistant" that she got FB to shut down four people's business pages in 18 hours!   I contacted FB  again to report this and again no response, no rectification on the people who have been adversely affected by this woman's actions.  She holds NO trademark to the words Instant Assistant!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Who doesn't love Facebook come on now	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Links from other apps to Facebook pages do not work?? They did but not anymore since the update. Now all links from other apps to Facebook pages just launch the Facebook app and do not direct to the desired page. Would be sweet to fix this!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I absolutely love Facebook, it's how I stay on the up and up and keep in touch with my network. If you don't like Facebook well you should probably walk into oncoming traffic	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Current News Feed is now 7 days old... even after reboot... useless! Vote 1, #CrapApp! And today at 10am I found nothing for today from my friends. This News Feed issue has been going on for years and the App Techs have ignored this issue totally. I guess it will never be fixed, just waste the project name space! Wife says it's F_CKING USELESS, even on her iPad! My wife doesn't usually swear! App devs, you have reached a very low point! :(	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Wow. It takes a lot for me to actually take time to write a negative review for an app. On my iPhone 5, the new FB "update" means that it never loads. It just says "Updating..." with the little rotating circle of death until the end of time... no matter whether you restart the phone or not. Every once in a while it will load a couple statuses (stati?). Now I can't use this app when I need to for a nonprofit cooperative I help manage. All my other apps are screaming fast.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It crashes AND it lags when you want to see a photo or open a link. It is better then any other app for facebook, or safari, though. I still love it!!!<3	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

I think this app is very good. I almost enjoy better than actually getting on Facebook From computer. The only thing I would suggest that they improve is that we should be able to set customized privacy from the app as well like you can do from the computer. Example: everyone can see post except Mr. John Doe, Jane Doe, The Cosby'sNo one can see post  except Jane Doe, John Doe, The Corby's. Would love be able to do that without having to log into my account online from my computer or thought the browser on my phone. Hope they actually make that change one day other than that its a pretty good app. I'm just saying......	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook has become intensely slow, battery draining, and crashes every single time you re-open the app.  Not to mention the fact that you have to reset your News Feed every time you come back on the app.  In all, you're better off using Safari for your Facebook.  The app has just became a major disappointment, and a waste of my time.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very frustrating. Have to relaid several times when I want to play videos. Please fix!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

This latest version is much improved, and does run so much smoother than before. I've downgraded my review by one star however due to their inability or deliberate ignoring of the issue getting it to show the posts in order of most recent. I do not want Facebook deciding which posts are important to me, I just want to see them in order. Regardless of how many times I change it it then reverts to some strange order and this is becoming very irritating.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

This latest facebook update is awful. I keep having up delete the app and add it again. It works great for shout a day and then it bugs up again- I see the same post multiple times in a row; cannot view comments, pictures, or see the whole post/status update; and it automatically will send me to the top of my newsfeed when I am scanning through all of them. I don't know what happened, it used to work great!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

First big problem is that Facebook doesn't seem to interface with the iPad very well, often freezing up, slow or failing to load pages, losing postings and shuffling items mercilessly.Facebook itself could be vastly improved if "it" only listened to its users, even just a little...minor things like finding, sorting, saving various types of postings, adding further options for input, some that may be more critical than just being able to "lLIKE" or comment......it is vastly popular despite its many shortcomings, largely because it was first and so most utilized...but unless they respond to users ongoing and often vociferous complaints, a competitor will arise than will make them history.UPDATE: PROBLEMS WITH IPAD HAVE CONTINUED TO ESCALATE TO WHERE IM ABOUT TO JUST GIVE UP !!!....I much prefer using iPad for size, and format of pages, but when it don't work, it just don't work ! 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This most recent update is terrible. Buggy as hell and still slow performance..Also, why is there no feature to export or sync events to iCal in iOS?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I've read bad reviews and generally thought "if the complainer just had a little patience with the app it works fine". Not this time. I was prompted to update my app Tuesday 6/18/2013. Since I have updated the app I have not been able to use the app. By this I mean it won't update my newsfeed unless I turn my brand new iPhone 5 off and turn it back on again. And when it does work after turning my phone off, I have a window of about 2 minutes before the app won't update again. I know the site itself is working as I receive email notifications just fine. I simply can't view them on Facebook because your last update screwed up the app. Please fix ASAP.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everything LOOKS good. I like the option to select moods and stuff but there are comments i cant see nomatter how many times i refresh. I have to goto my browser just to see comments ppl have put up on my thread sometimes. Old version was better. I can live without mood settings	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app always crashes, and it keeps freezing. It also keeps logging me out, so i have to log back in like 10,000 times in order to post something or to look at a page. I very much dislike the updates because in my opinion all that has happened is you've made the app even harder to operate. So therefore, instead of always checking my newsfeed and chatting with my friends on the Facebook app itself, i use the Facebook Messenger app, which actually functions for sending messages.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App is descent, sometimes it takes awhile for pics and things to upload. That's my only complaint	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Thank you Facebook programmers and your infinite wisdom!  I'm glad you show me what YOU want me to see on my newsfeed and not what I want to see.  Every time I share something it defaults back to "top stories".  Top stories for who?!I'm about to delete this app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It seems better now the update two days ago, lets hope it stays consistent As it seemed to run slow before & that was using my wifi I will rate it again when I have used it more in the week but happy with Facebook so far keep it up please	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Now we can share the pictures,thank you!! But now it's Slow :(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I haven't been able to load more than 10 minutes worth of content in days. Haven't been able to see anything new in 14 hours. Not worth using at all until it is fixed. I'd rather use my phone than my iPad at this point.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Comments are unreadable. Pictures take forever to load. Have to close and reopen app, restart my phone then close and reopen app again for it to update. Seems like the past few updates have made the app slower and worse then it used to be, may have to do like everyone else and use Facebook from my phones browser.A grocery list of problems is what you have with this app, I would expect more from such a successful company	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm using wifi and data and the app is not loading anything seems I don't have  connection. It's loading and loading pages but it never load :(Too bad !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

When u delete something off your timeline it crashes and the app turns off and goes onto the home screen. It is very slow. And you cannot add more than 1 photo/video at a time	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
When I saw that there was an update, I thought "finally! The constant crashing will stop". But, I was wrong. STOP ADDING STUFF UNTIL YOU FIX THE AP CRASHING EVERY FIVE MINUTES. Please and thank you.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Where are the b-day reminders? Sharing posts is a pain. Please, app developers, just imitate what you have on the website.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Well the "Bug fixes" apparently weren't for what everyone is complaining about... The app still crashes EVERY time I try to use it. The current version crashes every time I open it. I had issues with other bugs in the past, but this is ridiculous! I can barely read the first two or three stories in my newsfeed before it crashes on me. Instead of adding new features, how about fix the old problems!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
On my 3GS the app crashes almost daily and sometimes for specific functions like commenting on a post will send it crashing. I have uninstalled and then re in stalled it with great hopes but still same results. I like FB but don't like the mobil app version	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

More convenient than using Safari but the mobile web version is better. There are no birthday notifications. Viewing pictures make the app crash. Every time the app is tweaked it slows it down and makes it more unstable. The early versions were way better. Keep it simple!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I just recently updated this app & now every time I log on, the app is frozen up. I need to completely shut down the app and log in brand new. In addition, pictures no longer want to load and pages are not loading! Completely frustrating! Please help fix this once, amazing app!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's an alright app. The only thing is if you go out of it to text someone or because of another app and try to go back into this app, it doesn't fluke it and decided to freeze and send you back to the main screen of your phone,	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
A pointless "update" which only added features that aren't that useful which made it even SLOWER. I downloaded the new "update" in hoped that it would run faster, but nope... same old same old. Ridiculous Facebook..	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It keeps telling me in the alert icon on my home screen I have 10+ notifications, I don't. It takes about 10 or more seconds to view a picture and I can't click for comments.. When I click a picture it shows for a second then goes black.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's a great app- there are only a few things that I use Safari for Facebook, such as changing the caption on a picture and to use FB as a displayed on normal webpage. Few things that would make it easier= When I upload pictures through the photos "share", it would be great to be able to tag friends then before posting. It would be great to edit photo albums and pictures through the app. It would be great to do a short display of birthdays etc for the day when you bring the app up, like how safari displays it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Now I would really like to have given Facebook more stars but as a platform on iPad 2 it is probably the most annoying I use.. It's bug ridden to hell, I have had my iPad checked out twice with apple and they say there Is nothing wrong with it at all... Instead of bringing out minor adjustments to the format, I would suggest that if Facebook really want there large money maker to continue its success, it would be better to fix the problems Facebook has on certain systems... Works fine on my laptop, but iPad is slow, locks up, unresponsive... Please don't say "it's another app causing the problem".. Well I have had nothing installed apart from Facebook just to prove that and it's no different... Oh we'll 2 out of 5 for me...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Open close reopen close reopen close give up.  This is what's been happening  since the last update.  Every time you try to look at a picture or comments the app closes.  Really?

Although this version is much better than previous ones (still many improvements are necessary: when tagging distinguishing between. Being with someone and merely naming them is necessary, for example) I don't get why it crashes so often. And now, I have a permanent red number 1 badge notification despite the fact I have no notifications. Reinstalling the app didn't help. What the what!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It doesn't work (I have a 4S).  The app opens to a blank FB screen, hangs then closes. Reinstalling doesn't help either. Reading other reviews it looks like I am not the only person with this problem. Avoid this version and wait for the next update when this will hopefully be fixed, in the meantime it looks like I'll have to fire up the old PC if I want to check FB...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I can't do ANYTHING without it crashing,lagging, or just freezing. Every time I try to load a picture, it crashes and goes to the homescreen. The message bubble things are retarded. Everything that you add on to this crappy app, lags all of us even more. I don't even wanna rate this app one star because of how slow it is. You minus well just take the app off the AppStore because no one likes it. It's pointless .	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Hay alguna solucion a esto??Gracias por su comprencionI love facebook	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like it a lot but I do no like when u go to write a post that the photos are the 1 st thing that pulls up. However I do like how much easier it is to get to ur photos now to upload them	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
After the updated my fb app I was disappointed to find out that I could no longer save photos from fb to my phone, I couldn't change my profile pic from my phone, or my cover photo.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I dont use the app to catch up with friends - why would I when there's so many interesting adverts for crap and services I managed to live without for all these years?How about putting all my friends posts on a separate wall & keep the main page just for all your wonderful ads?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Crashes, crashes, crashes. Even with full signal or wifi. I try to open a picture, it freezes and closes, try to open my notifications it closes. Just scrolling through my feed, it closes. Needs a lot of work. Bugs need fixin'.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
If you want an app for hours of endless frustration, this is the one to have. It freezes constantly, too much development is spent on dumb features, and I still have no way to change who is viewing my posts... I give up on Facebook's privacy preferences! Facebook, either fix this app for real or forget your updates all together, seriously.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
No way to edit an already posted status. No way to edit a recently added event.  If I post a picture my friends can "Like" "Comment" and "Share" but if I'm posting pictures of my child I don't want other people to share my pictures! And I don't want the friends of my friends to see pictures my pictures just because its been liked.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Since this new update, I can't look at pics or see comments. Great update come on really!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook. You fail at life. my sh** doesn't work, it always freezes, now I try updating and it won't update. AND on top of that its stuck halfway through so I can't even use the app. Get your effin priorities straight. you guys are an embarrassment to technology. If I could put 0 stars I would, instead you guys are getting more credit than you deserve with my 1 star	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After installing the lasted update, I rebooted my ipad just like I do after I install or update every app.  After the reboot.... The Facebook app icon disappeared.  I cannot uninstall it because there is nothing to uninstall. I cannot download the app again because it says its installed already. I'm at a loss on this.  I now have to use safari to open Facebook online. I have the very latest ipad, it's 6 months old. It's not the ipad.. It's the app. Please fix this issue.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Good app no problems with it I'm on it all day too lol 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
There are still several important features - like highlighting posts of significance the the APP cannot do. The tasks the APP is doing are all functional and OK.Dev. Team: why not just make the APP do what desktop can do? If Fbook doesn't become as good on mobile as on the www employers will close out access to staff; critically decreasing effectiveness of the social platform. Get a move on, you've had enough time!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
I love it. Up to date and quick. Sometimes it shuts down without warning, but not too often. Otherwise, I use it constantly and love it!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have this app on my iPad mini , it's very fast & it doesn't crash at all & when i upload a picture or a pust it takes like 2 second . i love it thanks for the app thanks for the update  ! 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app tells me that I have 4 notifications but when I press it the app shows me nothing or maybe one notification! I'm deleting this app and I'm just gonna go online!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever since I upgraded the app all it does Is crash, barely ever loads, and when it does it takes forever to load anything like pictures or videos! It's a bunch of crap and should be fixed. I've talked to a lot of my friend and they agree that they're having the same problems!Total JUNK!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Je sui satisfant	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Functional, but is still not very user friendly.  Have trouble doing even some of the more simpler functions and frequently have to go to standard Web version to make configuration changes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Although I like the new additions the app has to offer, I would say the update really was disappointing! What's the use of the cool features if you don't get to use the app? It literally crashes atleast twice everytime I try to use. The messaging has become really slow and it freezes for a while everytime when someone messages me I try to reply to someone. If someone is still using the previous update, please do not update to this version! I hope a new faster update comes in soon!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Have an iphone 4s? dont upgrade this the new version. Bad Upgrade! c'mon developers!Sure, the GUI is nice.... But the actual function is as slow as snot... Errors on logging in, and is barely functioning on my iPhone 4S!!  It's pretty much useless...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pretty good just need to work our kinks of App freezing and screen issues!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

The new update has rendered this pretty useless. It constantly stalls or crashes. About as useful as a tramp's collar.  Don't bother.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
THE APP KEEPS FORCE CLOSING I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT AND ITS REALLY ANNOYING	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This has to be the worst client Facebook could have possibly released for the iPhone. Nothing shows up.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the book a lot but I hate it when it changed cuz it makes you update and changes what you just learn; how to share photos how to tag, it shut downs on its own way to much you get penalized when trying to get on celeb pages when they tell you to add them, comments disappear I written to complain but nothing, I think people be controlling my page. I don't think we should get punish for trying to connect to celebs pages.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Crashes and is really slow	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Since downloading the latest version, the Facebook app keeps quitting.It would also be really nice if we could have message notifications for all pages.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Are you even listening to us? I updated the app and it STILL CRASHES. Fix this! It's ridiculous. I'm about to stop using the app and just use Safari. FIX THIS.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The recent update you did is awful. The app takes forever to update or it will not even update. Please fix ASAP. Thanks!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
In find friends mode the abbreviated alphabet is no longer on the side to skip ahead to who I'm looking for; the info of when someone is logged in isn't always true--if u want to chat with/send personal message to someone u have to refresh the screen several times before the actual data will update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
App crashes, pictures take forever to load, and when they finally do, it only loads up half the picture. Stop updating fb. You arent helping anyone. Just irritating the worlds population.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's OK. It can definitely be improved though.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

it's awesome...when it doesn't crash.or when it doesn't erase my comments right after I post them.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
The app as a app works fine. What I think about what Facebook does with it or what they add or don't add is another story. My review is only as asked to rate the app. And that review is it a good app and works fine.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's ok I guess.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

It works better now on my iPhone 4 & love how emotions were added to the app!! The only problem is that is keeps closing itself here and there but not as much as it did before.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Since I updated my facebook it's been all crazy and super slow.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest version now has stupid chat bubbles that cover up parts of the interface. No obvious way to disable this poor design change.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's great I love using this app I am confident it will continue to get better and better! Keep up the good work and thank you for your service!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Unfortunately it's the only decent way to use facebook on a phone/ipad, I hate when I share now on a picture it jumps all over the place, hate that I can't tell if I'm looking at most recent or newsfeed or what, and I especially hate that facebook openly censors and/or manipulates pages that they disagree with politically, I miss the old facebook, back when myspace was still alive, it's too much of a monster now.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the app, but have some issues with it. Some days I open the app and it immediately bumps me out.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

No one likes the landscape mode. No one likes the other useless crap that slows down the software. Fix the stability first then work your way up. The app crashes WAY too much. I can't see an image in a message without the app crashing first.

No words can say how much I love Facebook. Jk there is one word drama -.- 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I like the convenience of this app, and most of the interface, but it remains slow and crashes a lot. Almost every time I click a picture, it freezes, and it crashes often just opening pictures and links. Also, if I try to play a video, it takes minutes to load and freezes during playback. If I open it safari, it plays fine. Every time there's an update, I get excited thinking maybe they fixed the crashing problem, but it still crashes.....	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Disgusted that this company has so many ties with politicians ($ backing etc...) that have NO respect for our privacy.  In case you forgot NOTHING on the web is sacred.  ESP not on FB, think about it.  All that knowledge of all of us, huge amount of power in that :'-(.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

This new update won't let me upload pictures, and it won't send pictures from Instagram onto to timeline. Very disappointed! Please fix!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So when I'm scrolling through my newsfeed, and find a post on a friends/liked page I want to read I open it and 2 seconds later Facebook crashes. Then I reopen Facebook set the news feed back to "Most Recent" but it seems that most if not all of the posts I just read have disappeared. If this is facebooks way of saying "sorry for the crashes. Here please start where you left off", its not good enough. Just stop the crashes entirely...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Phone app for facebook is not really good. Apart from uploaded photos easier from phone to facebook... I can't think what else is better on. If u accidentally post something on your phone Facebook just can't delete it unless u use your pc Facebook.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Ipad use typically crashes when I try to follow a link or watch a video... To avoid this I forward into safari.  When i return FB takes me to the most recent news feed post so I lose the post I was interested in and must work all the way down the feeds to find it.  Should have an option to stay where you last read and to scroll up to newest.  Don't like the online and chat bar on the page either. Should have an option to turn that off.  And lastly I don't like all the political censoring by FB.  Shows obvious bias.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's has crashed more than I care to say. They have some more bugs to work out.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Privacy IssuesWhen I approve a Friend request PLEASE DO NOT Post it on the Feed for Everyone to see. I Do NOT want everyone to know who I have approved. If they want to dig through y friends list to see that's one thing. But PLEASE do not notify my friends that I've "become" friends with someone. I feel violated. Please make a Setting to stop this or just stop it all together. No one needs to know when people add people as friends **update this please**Not to mention. I'm constantly kicked out still.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pathetic. I can't even get the app to open at all and I've deleted and re-installed it many times and still nothing.! Optimise the app for iPhone 4S and other devices, not just iPhone 5!! It was all working fine until the new updates.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Glitchy. Doesn't always update comments. Sometimes they erase your posts if political. Timeline gives easy access to your info. Scetchy. Also if you meet a new friend in "real" life and try and "friend" them, without any mutual friends, Facebook punishes you by suspending your friend request feature for 30 days. Lame. Also if you have political or spiritual principles that don't align with fascistbooks views, your account gets edited by the admins. If you friend new and interesting people you don't know, they'll suspend you from friend request for being overly social on their social network.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook is so easy to use through the app for an iPhone or other apple devices. I like how you can organize your friends into groups and set certain settings for individual people. Facebook  just keeps getting better.- the only thing I do not like is the new message thing where you have to drag the persons little circle to the bottom of the page that's annoying an unnecessary !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook is not updating when I open it up on my Ipad. Everything else on my Ipad functions correctly but this app. What's the problem?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Unstable. Great for connecting but you don't feed everyone I'm connected too. It's good for friends, but terrible for reliability; iPad app is worse than iPhone app ...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Facebook has brought me back to my old friends and lost loves and to keep us all connected. I check it everyday when I wake up and every night before I sleep. I don't think children under a certain age should has access to it though. There are some sick people preying on young men and woman. They should be blocked if they have a sex offender record.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
If we now can get copy and paste by tapping the screen, it would be a 5 star....yet I don't foresee this in the coming updates.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I've ended up deleting and using safari rather than the app. It crashes, freezes and misses out posts! Epic Fail!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I like this new update! It's easier to talk to your friends, given that the app allows you to speak almost anywhere on Facebook. I signed up for the new newsfeed in March but I'm still waiting for it to appear on my computer. The newsfeed on this new Facebook update looks very clear and and it's easier to navigate around Facebook! The new "Chat heads" chat messaging system is easy to use and is one of the aspects of Facebook, I really enjoy. A fantastic app overall!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Works really well	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes a lot!  Every time I try to post a pic it crashes. I don't like that it won't go into landscape when I turn my phone. Would make it easier to post comments, etc.  I HATE that it constantly goes back to "news feed" when I pick "most recent".	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
With the latest update I now need to tell it to show me all recent posts every time I open the app.  Even then it's not showing me all of my friends' posts.Facebook, please stop trying to tell which of my friends' posts you think are most important.  I will decide that for myself.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is a joke, the newest version on iPhone 5 constantly crashes, it shows you have new messages but won't even load them up, closes when you try to open it & freezes when you try to view pics. If you can deal using browser based Facebook id strongly recommend it, this is a headache you DON'T need!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
latest version worse than the prior...funny how i can do a search in the net one day then there are ads for that search on facebook the next & i had my privacy set so my profile doesn't come up on a google search & now it does...Posts from friends are buried under ads, suggested pages, & app ads...need a similar app to facebook purity that's out for windows pc's...freezes frequently...now the little bubble of a picture of the person who sent a msg?  gotta drag & drop to an X at the bottom of the page to get rid of it...all the updates in the past few months i'd hope the app would get better, not worse...but worse is what it got!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App either doesn't load or takes forever. Also would like to be able to view FB in landscape.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Update made it running slow. And my app looks totally different Why is this. My mom daughter and niece did the update and their app looks nothing like mine. Notifications friends News feed Message etc. everything is at the bottom of the app why is this fix it back the way it was. Please and thank you.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Everytime I open the app, I see a few posts, then it sends me back to the top and then I see two of every post. Can't get notifications, can't comment, can't share, can't see who likes things. Complete fail! And who actually wants news fees?!? I want MOST RECENT!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My review is this, when I am on Facebook I really enjoying talking toMy friends & Family! It's just a clickTo get my service. Fast source ofCommunication! It's Great!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This is a great app connecting but they should make it that u can edit picture such as crop them and rotate it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
This update has a big improvement, since I used to have to start it several times before it loaded up without crashing. Would be better if it didn't try to give me a tutorial on the new chat heads that were in the previous update. But great over all.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Can't share in my page	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Hands down the worst app on my 2 year old iPhone 4. Each update gets worse, crashes, freezes, slower than a 1 legged tortoise and can't even show "most recent" when I select it, let alone remember my choice when returning. Appalling considering the pedigree. Sack your dev team and start again.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Likes and Comments work for a while then they don't for a longer time. Frustrating when you are trying to communicate with family and friends!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm sick of all these ads popping up in my newsfeed. Some of them are wildly inappropriate, like fireworks events while our city is on fire, or batman the morning after the aurora shooting. It's obnoxious really	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
New update is horrible, just loads and loads.....can't use at all	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the update, but it keeps booting me out of Facebook on my iPod -.- and it's very aggravating .	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I hate how i'll like something and then it will automatically update my news feeds and move me to the beginning of them instead of leaving me were I'm at.  Even sometimes it will update and it will move and skip a story or too!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time you guys "fix" or "improve" Facebook you just screw it up!!. This latest version j's by far the worst... You can't see the posts from friends it won't allow me to post anything... You are causing a lot of people to stop using Facebook	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app always crashes and I can't view photos properly either. The photo loads part way then stops or ill try to zoom out to view the entire photo and it snaps back.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

After all the recent updates, it has gotten much slower to load messages and crashes regularly.  This app turning into garbage.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Under the most current update at least, FB crashes completely randomly all the time. It's very annoying. If that one problem was fixed I'd give it 5 stars.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I think Facebook needs to quit putting blocks on peoples account and quit discriminating against people with Disabilities and people who are conservative and people who are tea party people also please remember Facebook and Mark Zuckerburg are in the tank for Obama if you are a conservative and a tea party person I would highly suggest you go to tea party community and not facebook and facebook still has not taken the 30 day block off my account and needs to ASAP and facebook has allowed porn and allowed a chef to put a page up to promote the killings of cats and dogs by cooking them very sick and has allowed the sex trafficking of young kids and prostituting and bullying on there websites	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

The app still shuts down on its own.i hate that it updates automatically when someone posts something new and it scrolls me back to the top. It gets very annoying when I'm reading a post or scrolling through and suddenly have to start from the top again. I also want to be able to unfollow and hide people from my newsfeed using the app instead of having to wait until I can get to a computer.I also hate the photo synching!!! I don't want ALL the pictures I take on my Facebook. If I did I'd post them myself	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Facebook won't work on my mobile device (iPod5) since updating to 6.2. No problem on laptop or PC. I have logged off/on a few times, and deleted/reinstalled the app a few times...still not working. Won't allow me to comment or share pics...just continuously shows "updating" but never actually updates. Frustrating.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update messed the whole app up.  Can't click pictures or comments..... Please fix it stinks!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This app WAS good..... Now won't even load. Just a blank screen on timeline, no news is bad news. Can only think this has something to do with the latest update as it was running perfectly until I updated the app.As the title says - SORT IT OUT!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Awsome	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
For the most part, I find it difficult to use. If you want to share something the screen, it jumps around and doesn't take you back to where you were. There is no privacy and Facebook colludes with the government to spy on American citizens. I am just glad I didn't fall for the hype and limit my use.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Lately, when I share a link it can be sent once or copied up to 4 times!  What's up with that?  Sometimes changing settings doesn't work.  And I don't want pages recommended to me.  I'm now having to pay to get more followers to see my ranch page.  This is a teeny-tiny ranch and the costs per view are too high.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Iphone 4- When I open app it takes forever to load content. And then I can't even get notifications unless I open app. Inbox message notifications don't show unless I open it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It does what it needs to do. But. It's very slow, very flaky and constantly changing and more often than not, not for the better. Annoying there is no landscape version. Odd that status updates by friends shared with my gf don't appear on mine but do on hers. And so the list could go on... Oh and NOW the notification overlay that blocks the notification list and then if you don't click it loses the unread status of the notification! Shoddy.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
To be honest,it is rubbish. I downloaded it and it took 5 minutes to load the first time. Suddenly an error appeared and said I had to uninstall an app to keep facebook running clear. So I did what it said and deleted facebook after always waiting minutes for it to load-_-	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Runs way too slow. Takes forever for content to load. Facebook doesn't seem to care to fix it. No wonder the stock is tanking.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Mine doesn't crash at all :/  great app ......	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Facebook USED to be the bomb.com, however ever since twitter came out, it has definitely spiraled out of control. You all should have kept Facebook the way it was before all that timeline mess you added. Now it's all confusing. What's the point of a timeline for FACEBOOK? You should've remained with the ORIGINAL ideas of Facebook, not this new bs!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I wish I'd never updated my old app, it worked perfectly!  This update tells me I have 32 hits and I'll only have like 3, which is just a minor thing. The real irritation is uploading pix from my photo roll. I'll chose a pix and when I press upload it will upload another pix or sometimes it will have already chosen 5 other pix that I didn't even see. Very aggravating!  Never had this problem with the last update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Okay I love the app But it would be better if you add a video chat feature please I really need it I know that Facebook on a computer has the video chat thing but I need to have it on my iPod/phone	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love the Facebook app, it's easy to use but you need to update again, I'm getting so annoy how it keeps crashing on me when I'm trying to send a friend a message! Or even just loading it, it will crash moments later... Please fix what ever is causing this!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Facebook needs to stop changing.  Other then that it's ok for now. And every time I click out of Facebook I have to resign into Facebook iv never had to do that.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app when it works properly	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I am glad they updated the Facebook app., now it has a share button. The only thing I don't really like is the chat bubbles they are kind of annoying. I do like that you can change your profile pic from the app now, the next thing that should be added is the ability to change your cover photo from the app as well.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love it	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still... Your adding more sh*t before you fix what's broken. Your going from bad to worse. Don't you read your reviews? I see more and more people joining google+ Looks like face books going to be the next myspace. Obsolete!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Really good, fast and easy to use	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Facebook won't load since the new up date. It just sits there with that annoying star-loading symbol. Please fix! It's been "updating" my news feed for 6 hours now.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Whenever I open any picture on my timeline, it either crashes the app or takes multiple minutes to load and grant touch screen capabilities again. It's frustrating.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I tried to update the app but now the update won't even load. All my other updates worked just fine, but I have been waiting for the facebook app to update for almost 30 minutes. It hasn't even started the update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is a good way to stay in touch with people.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love the new up date!!!!!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook on iPhone is just bad. There are several important and common features I use that I just can't control from the iPhone, and worse, insane "chat heads" pop up constantly. They are utterly worthless and cannot be turned off. I hate them. I wish Facebook would stop adding features and just make the thing work nicely.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love fb!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

Brilliant app just well slow	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
MyMain complaint is that my app suddenly closes for no reason and then takes a really long time to re open. Its an annoyance.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
So far so good with the latest upgrade!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Recurred a message asking me to update NOW it won't update keeps giving me errors FIX THIS staring to hate iPhone Facebook	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Amazing	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Do they purposely make it worse with every update?!Slow, lags, comments don't appear so you type them again only to see later it's showed up twice. You must be one of the most popular apps on iOS, SORT. IT. OUT!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I love this APP! I love all the new features with this update 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook for IPhone is awesomeHavent had any problems so far apart from the crashing every now and then	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Works great and is a huge improvement over the old web app version.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love the design and features if the app, but it is very slow at times. But still would recommend it :P	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Great way to keep in touch with friends & relatives.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Not bad but not nearly as good as it should be. Still better than using Safari to access the site on an ipad.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

I use Facebook everyday on my iPod. And I can use it for like 10 minutes then the app stops working and I have to delete the app and get it back . It has happened ever since I got the Facebook app.! And I don't like it !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I post something it takes me back to the beginning of the news feed. Also if I want most recent, can it stay on most recent? I'm sick of having to read half of updates through most recent & then comb through news feed to find the rest. Put it back to the way it was an up date or 2 back	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Awsomee	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I've always found the FB app busy and crashes, mostly when opening links but also when looking at photos. With every new update I hope this has been fixed. But latest update is worse than ever!!!!! :-(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
This is way better then having it on blackberry !!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Feel like app is finally working!! Chat heads are very convenient and they fixed them now, through a update in the app, sometimes Facebook will improve without Updates	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
When I thought things were getting better, I was wrong. Awful update. Slow, lags when scrolling, crashes, pictures rarely load. I could go on. You need to seriously hire developers that know how to do their jobs. This is getting ridiculous.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I use facebook message it crashes and it's really annoying! Please fix!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes when attempting to post a picture. Annoying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate how messaging is on I5, how you have to take the message to the trash or it stays on your screen at all times. Kinda slow and I think they can do better. Horrible.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
La verdad lo de las burbujas no me gusta, me desespera	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I like this app, it allows me to check Facebook without having to get on a computer	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

So annoying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Super slow updating all the time, crashes and doesn't post things half the time...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Constantly crashing, you have to close and reopen multiple times to get things to load....come on, surely you can do better!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I open it, it will crash at some point during use. Also frustrating that you can't view chat on iPad unless rotated horizontally which is not the case on iPhone.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I like having this app on my phone, bc I can keep my place in Facebook, while I use my other browser to check around for info online before I post. I haven't really been having trouble with this app at all.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Occasionally the app doesnt record my postings and I'll have to go back and do it again. Other than that, no issues.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This app is horrible! It constantly crashes, it's slow to open, and won't allow me to look at pictures without crashing. Fix it right ASAP!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everything is good, but you can't stay offline in messenger so I don't use it. In-app chat can be done staying offline but the keypad can be used well if it can be rotated. So make the changes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Facebook is really boring now and I feel like Facebook in general needs something more than just a blank blue and white profile, like and comment statuses, and better security in general. The colors are dull and very boring. It should be customizable. Also, a big issue is that it's turned into a part time porn site. Very inappropriate.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app solved a lot of my problems when I accessed Facebook from my iPad.  Before only rarely could I watch a video that someone posted.  Also,  I used to do a continuation comment because my fat fingers used to hit return and post a comment before I was finished.  Easy peasy...problem solved!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love Facebook, but this app always takes too long to load, or it kicks me out of the app, and it freezes constantly. :/ disappointed	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not sure why everyone is having so many problems.  The Facebook app has always worked fine for me, regardless of the version I have.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

It's good. It crashes here and there but I just think its my iPhone. Doesn't happen on my girlfriends Samsung	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
At first this app was terrific, loved it, no problems. NOW all I get is kicked off all the time. Some of my posts don't show up some photos do show up and I manage a page that logs me out of my wall and asks for a password to my managed page, which by the way are both  on FACEBOOK . I don't get it and no one will contact me back. I. Have written several messages about Facebook freezing and then crashing, and this last one with the page I manage. Not sure I would give this app 3 stars but at least in the beginning, back in 2007, it was pretty good till you started messing with things. Ever heard of don't fix it if its NOT BROKE??? Not happy but this is my vice to keep in touch with my family and all my friends. Leafl	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great way to keep informed & reuniting w/friends :)	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes every time its opened.  Deleted it and reinstalled it with no change.  Update did not help either.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Likes: - the option of sending a message saying why someone said on you timeline etc.- instant share button- the fact that you can see emojis- the set up of the whole app yet, I would like to see it look alot more like 'Instagram' with the things on the bottom instead of the top? (Just a suggestion) - it doesn't crash as much as it used to, it still does just not as much as the last versionDislikes:- bubble inbox- how long it takes to load a persons page/ comments etc.- it's starting to look like twitter with all the highlighted hash tags - newsfeed could be betterSuggestions: - you should get rid of the bubble inbox, it's annoying and gets in the way all the time and just pops open when someone sends you something- change it to a more similar layout to Instagram - have an option where you can manually view who you want in your personal newsfeedThank you for your time!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Crashes all the time. Takes forever to load and open pages	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

You should let us to be able to edit our group info like the description and group photo on	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook updates too much!! The last update does make picture/video sharing easier. The app does still close a lot on its own. Overall it's good but needs updates to better the app problems not the actual layout of the pages.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's always Crashing ! I have to re-open it all the time .! I would be better off using Safari to get on Facebook . Don't download this app .	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The messaging system is really buggy and for me, is shaking more than a toddler suffering from an epileptic seizure. The text also overlaps or doesn't show up. But other parts Seam to be okay, so far...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I wish the app had more of the mobile features it also crashes a lot, but other then that its ok.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I'm just learning about computers --age 74--you change everything so fast makes learning that much harder.  When I look for something--it has gone away.  I'm not to happy with that.

I am unable to rate the actual app because it won't load.  It's just stuck in loading mode for two days.  The good news is this nonfunctioning status sounds much better than the update itself.  Happy happy joy joy.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

How convenient! Fb right at the tips of my fingers 24/7! I never miss a friend request! (I'm famous lol!)	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I really wish I could see all posts. Every time!! without having to command it to most recent posts, every time I open the app. Super frustrating.  Also, I don't think it's everyone's business every time I like a post.  No one cares to see that in their feed.  Fix those two things and we're golden.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can't open links. Says there are notifications when there aren't.  Crashes.  Terrible.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is slow and it freezes it closes all the time I'm not impressed at all.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook now won't load. I hate all the new updates. I have to go through safari to get my Facebook to load. Not cool!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is crack. The app is crap. Can't set most recent? Can't share without it popping me up to the top? Can't extend time gap zig zag. I don't like Twitter, but they've got it all over you in the app department.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Learning to enjoy it. I m a senior, so it took a while.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

It is what it is	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Useful, of course, but it lags so much, freezes, shuts down, and I've had to reinstall twice recently. Using the browser is faster.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Honestly, I thought the update would improve things but no. Just added more annoyance to the mix. I'm sick of it being SO slow to load and I'm sorry but does most recent not mean anything to you folk?! Jeez! I used to love fb app and barely used the laptop but you're really taking the mickey these days! Photo sharing is cr@p and most days the app crashes when I open it or, if I'm lucky enough that it doesn't, it will when I try to click on a photo! Sort it out please fb. This is beyond a joke.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Do not download this app. Use Safari and do not support the moribund programmers behind this dreck. Apple is supposedly at the forefront of technological accessibility. Yet their Facebook app, surely one of the most used by iPhone owners worldwide, is trash. It crashes constantly and frequently fails to load when refreshed. There is no reason whatsoever for this app to be so atrocious. If I could sum up my impression of Facebook for iPhone in one word, it would be "pathetic;" given two words, "REALLY pathetic."Update: The "face bubbles" in place of message notifications are preposterous--and it now crashes at least three times daily. This app is so shameful I've considered deleting my Facebook profile altogether. Not the app, my profile. You are failing at success, programmers.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Since the updates, I have been dealing with a lot of opening then re-opening and it seems as though others have too. Hopefully this issue will get fixed. Or maybe it's the iPhones whose to really say	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Love the ease of the app, but hate that it crashes, does not show all posts that my friends, and those that I am following, post, and seems to start over on its own.  Also, with latest update, when I share an item, it does not take me back to where I was, but it takes me back to the beginning and changes from Most Recent to News Feed.  Very frustrating!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

May I suggest try to give a function that you can move photos from album to album and album folder so you can put your personal albums like example:Party albums- xmas party album- new year eve album- my birthday party albumSelf photo album- wearing cosplay- graduation pics- wearing tuxLike that can you do that so we can manage personal album its just like puting same albums in 1 shelfGood day facebook admins	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app is allowing my distanced family to come back together...in a beautiful way! THANK YOU!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Works just fine for me.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It would be better if I could watch videos & play games without Adobe (I have apple products)....I do like the ease of adding pictures, now.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can't even open up messages	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I am finding the app keeps getting worse. The big update a while back was a major improvement and I thought that was a starting point for it to keep getting better. Instead it keeps getting worse.One example is comments which do not appear even after I get a notification that there is a new comment. I use to be able to refresh comments, but now that is not an option.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love this app, Facebook was already an obsession for me but this mad it worse. It's fast,easy to update information and share pictures I Love it ‰_	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I have to constantly reinstalled the app and once I log on, the news feed wont show up. It takes forever and I'm not pleased at all.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love all the new picture tones and update icons added. Makes it more convenient to post fast updates and pictures.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This latest version is ridiculous! Continually grinding away 'updating' without ever doing so, that I have to delete the app on my iPad and reload it just to get it to work. Unbelievable.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The messaging takes FOREVER to update. It won't let me see messages in a group chat even after refreshing the app!!!! It constantly crashes and the iPad layout is very very bad. You need to fix it Facebook!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Anytime I try to switch from page to page, view pictures, or update my news feed it either takes about twenty seconds to do so or it freezes up and suddenly jumps to somewhere I didn't want it to go.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Seriously how has no one said anything about the photos yet? You click a photo and it freezes as it loads and the app locks up. If it doesn't do that, the picture is zoomed in but when you zoom out so you can actually see the whole thing, it just zooms straight back in again. Eventually after a few goes, it stays zoomed out but the damn menu that goes away by tapping the photo so you see it without any disruptions doesn't go away without zooming in the photo again. So many pictures that are big in resolution are not viewable properly it's happened for ages, like over a Year. Don't the developers get over this stupid problem?? Instead of introducing stupid, useless features, fix the basics first and THEN add whatever you want. OMG people!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
This still does not have a share option and has many of the same glitches.  Also does not have birthdate notifications.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	New Zealand
If u un-install and re-download it fix's the crash	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Terrible	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The last update for the the app made the layout  for the iPod 5 look good, the launch of the app is still to slow, it launches and it's a blue bar at the top and with a with bottom, still too many buttons, like when we want to view our own profile pic or cover photo, or when we want to logout, no landscape view, and that new picture with a status update would be awesome if you would add it to sharing, and now it seem like I can't get on my account like it took 4 tries to sign into the account and it only shows the loading spinning circle, and I quit out, the multitask close the app and then open it again and it still won't load a thing, and you guys also removed the option to like a page and turn of the ability for us to still like the page, also I have liked a page and I want to go to that page and the app won't let me go to the page because the page "can't be found" but I am still getting news feed from them and that means that page is still active, and I log out of Facebook and it sill keeps me logged in, bring back posting polls from website and bring it to the app	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app works better than it does on my computer!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
What's happening???It keeps crashing every time I want to access my profile...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The Fact That I Can't Up Load Videos Or Change My Cover Photo... Also I Dont Like That I HAVE To Crop The Picture That I Want For My Profile Picture..... Also I really dislike the news feed. I like my new feed to be left on "most recent" not top story or whatever. Thanks 	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This update is horrible. Timeline posts blend together, the app lags and hangs. And please lose the black notification banner at the top of the app. I don't need 2 notifications for 1 post, the red flag is enough.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Most bugs seem fixed, aside that random app shutdown (way less frequent then before), way faster.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

It randomly crashes all the time. No matter what I'm doing. Failbook app is more like it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app could be a bit better but overall is okay	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I wish that facebook was able to let you change your facebook color like unstead of blue "RED"	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Whenever I try and view my messages or a certain page, it always closes down.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
The app should show all my friends by most recent posts by default. I should not have to go select most recent every time and then still not see all my friends activity. Facebook=Fail	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have had a Facebook account for a while now and never really wrote anything in the comments very often but I started writing a nightly blurp a week ago and some of my fellow facebookers look forward to it and have compared it to a blog. I now really enjoy this social media thingy and look forward to my nightly writing,For that u give you a perfect 10 facebook.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Closes a lot on its own and crashes. Still constantly changes the order of my news feed. Seems to be worse with each update. Wish it would rotate to a landscape like my other phone features do. Not the best page management features either. Really wish I had more control over that while on the go.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I don't like the way that it posts your post long after they happen and it even freezes up. I hate the way that Facebook has gone and feel you should go back to the old way where there weren't so many problems and people could use it easier. I hate looking in and getting a white screen with blue across the top and nothing else. It's just getting worse to even have the app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
First, I can appreciate that programming for different platforms, such as the web versus mobile, can be daunting. However, over the history of the Facebook app I have found many inconsistencies in terms of incomplete features available on the web versus the mobile versions. Also, recently there appeared to be some type of dynamic updates going on behind-the-scenes that were causing multiple crashes.  I sometimes get the sense that the team that develops for the web does not work with the team that develops for mobile.It is my hopes that Facebook will take the mobile app to higher, more consistent and stable grounds.   I also highly encourage Facebook Inc. to consider a beta program. This is standard development practice.  They can enlist the help of hundreds of thousands of users to test features  and provide feedback on usability prior to releasing them into production.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I would prefer it if they stopped tinkering, they think it's going to make Facebook better, but that rarely happens! Security and privacy still wary about, and it seems that they adopt other social networks ideas.

I find myself using the app more hen the site.  However, it crashes every now and then.  They need to work on that.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes, too many updates, message bubble is annoying. It's hard to read a post because if something new shows up in the feed or you "like" a post or comment the feed scrolls back to the top. Now there's this annoying thing that opens up to add a picture even if you just want to post a simple comment in your status. I think I'm just going to use the web version. This is a royal pain. :-/	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sorry guys but someone failed on this new FB app.  Please bring back the old version.  Sometimes simple is better.  The more you mess with it the worse it seems to get.  You use to be able to start a message and leave it for a minute to do something else but now when you go back your half written message is gone and you have to begin all over again.  Getting too much garbage in newsfeed that I didn't request or "like".  What on earth is Candy Crush!  Don't want it, need it or want to see it!  Newsfeed isn't updating any longer unless you log out and log in again. Can't search for new friends any more.  Use to love FB but check your recent ratings guys, everyone's complaining sorry to say.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

This newest version is awful!! Why change it when it was fine the way it was. I have to take time to figure out where the hell everything is again. Stop messing with it! Put it back the way it was. I hate all of the info being at the bottom, it was better at the top! It's also closing out all the time. It drives me crazy. It's not good, I hate it!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
All these new features make browsing FB way harder than before. For one thing I can't exit out of the app to view my sms because the app starts over from the beginning of the newsfeed when I go back to it?! Let me know when you guys fix all this stupid upgrade meanwhile I'm using my web browser-CRASH FREEZE NO LANDSCAPE=CRAP--5-22-2013 this app doesnt understand the meaning of MOST RECENT when i repetedly touch most recent it always goes back to top stories (news stories) why?!?!?!?!6-20-2013 CRASH trying to check in and this version simply does not want to remember that I like MOST RECENT app=CRAP	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app get it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	New Zealand
Ever since the update, it freezes or lags when I try to see images. Also, when I go to neck my notifications, it doesn't load properly. For example, my friend invited me to an event page and it won't load.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works great.  Occasional rare crash. Facebook does do strange things to its newsfeed but the app itself is fine.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I like the ap. however i really hate the new thing that pops up to tell me every few seconds that someone commented on something. I thought thats what the icon at the top of the screen was for. Its super annoying. Please make it go away	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Post a comment, comment shows up, comment disappears..... Send someone a message, sending message, message disappears. This happens repeatedly. I have to copy EVERY comment I post bc I have to repost it at least 3 times before it actually stays.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Major messenger issues, tells me I have pending messages when none exist. Slow, unresponsive, takes forever to load. Even worse than the last release. Quit adding stupid functionality, streamline current product, improve performance, actually QA the bugs... Get your shot together.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It's great I even like the movie, it help me find lots of people I lost contact with.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Why did you take away the option to type with the phone turned to the side (iPhone)? Other than that, I guess it's okay.Also, stop with the pictures when I start a new post. Not digging the new update.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's working really good in iPhone but occasionally is disconnect or freezeBut is Facebook :)	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I don't like when I go to type a status it goes straight to my photo album and not to my keyboard. When I want post a pic I will hit the photo icon, otherwise give my back keyboard.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Esta aplicaciÌ_n es Excelente	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Horrible. Each update makes it worse. I will be in the middle of something and it kicks me out of facebook all together and I have to log in all over again.  Navigation stinks. It won't let you re-post or share posts the way I want or to someone else's wall like it does on the pc version.  Sending photos or posts in a private message is difficult pr not even a possible option. You are unable to customize who can see your posts.  You are unable to exclude a certain person from seeing your post. New posts are mixed in with older posts so you have to go thru posts you have already read to view the new stuff. It doesn't allow you to sort your news feed according to either most recent or by posts based on interests like the pc facebook does.  I only use the phone app when I don't have access to a pc now because I hate the new app changes and the user unfriendliness it is becoming	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Congratulations! The only thing you've succeeded at was making this update worse than the last one! I constantly get "Tap to retry" errors; when I scroll the view my news feed, it suddenly crashes and closes; it's slow as Hell; and the checkmarks are so stupid. You're a bunch of morons!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have no problems whatsoever with this app! It helps me keep in touch with all my family and friends! I would recommend it to everyone! Thanks Facebook! You Rock!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook is Facebook. I've had it for years. But now a days there are wayyyy too many crashes. It'll just log out and shut the whole app down. I will never leave Facebook sadly. It is the only social media I use. I've tried others but I just don't like them as much as Facebook.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Just switched from Droid to Apple, and it is working better than it has the past 6 months (knock on wood); so, I am pleasantly surprised...ask me in a few weeks though when the honeymoon phase is over!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This FB is more responsive, but it also is more restrictive in what you can say politically. The truth hurts sometimes, but you need to be able to tell it. On the other hand I would like to see vulgar language flagged. When it updates or refreshes you have to wait for the action to finish what you are doing. It is a good way for people to exchange ideas and keep the democratic process alive. This version updates a lot and holds up the actions like share or comment.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Please stop updating Facebook. PLEASE. If you guys truly go through with the hashtag idea, I think I will be deleting my account. You're losing your originality...you're losing the essence you began with, the essence of social media by blending with other social media outlets desperately trying to match their developments. A year ago I would have given you 5 stars. 6 months ago, 4, today I give you 2 based on exasperation from the constant alterations and in dread of your promise to rival twitter with hashtags. Don't do it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app was awesome but NOW its JUST so SLOW...AND CRASHES	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Takes three plus tries to open the app. Constantly switches from most recent to top stories whenever it wants. Also if you login for example at 4pm then dont login until 11pm that night all the stories that happened from 4pm-11pm wont show up unless at all. Im just deleting this crap and sticking to PC.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Buggy and news feed is stupid. Bring back most recent... Not this top story BS.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I use interest lists to keep up with my Facebook feed, but this latest redesign makes it almost impossible to use them.I can choose the list and start scrolling and reading no problem. But heaven forbid I need to put down my phone for a second or want to re-share something I find. Unlike the previous version, this one flips you back to the top of the feed instead of saving where you were last when you return to the feed. Very frustrating.At least they seemed to have fixed to constant crashing with this update, that's what the single star is for.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I love Facebook and this app has ruined it, when I'm listening to music and I click on a video to watch it on Facebook, the music obviously goes off, but when I want to listen to the music again it won't let me because the video hasn't stopped, also on the old update when you wanted to stop watching the video you could just scroll up or down away from the video, but it still plays, sort it out mate.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

For the most part the app has improved a great amount, but I find myself having to reopen FB after crashing several times a day. as a person who used FB a lot, this has brought me plenty of aggravation. I've been in several positions where I would write a long message, look through news feed, or scroll through pictures, and the app would just close on me. aggravating right?! Please fix bugs.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The new update is not user friendly and is super confusing. Facebook needs to stop "fixing" things that aren't broken before they become they land themselves in the social media grave yard like MySpace	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not loading news feed at all. Just freezes on one screen!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

The App shuts down for no apparent reason several times during use. I also get warnings I've got notifications and yet when I go on I have none. The App loads up the content in a disorganised manner so the timeline is not fluid. I do like the new message 'pop up head' design though!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This app is very unreliable.quite a few times on my iPhone it won't load a page or its still got stuff from the previous day or it just won't let me post and when I make a comment on the post it repeatedly disappears or if I can post it comes up 2 or 3 times	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Crash after crash crash crash crash crash crash!!!!!You guys keep upgrading and changing, when you need to transition a larger percentage of the workforce to fix the current repetitive bugs that are in the system that effect PC and Mobile usage... We need better tech support!!!It won't matter if Facebook finds Martians, if none of us stick around to see it!!!You're alienating us one by one as we are ignored on our growing issues...I even tried to reach Zuckerburg about these issues...If you guys don't fix yourselves in the first 2 quarters of 2013...

There are many times the pages freeze and wont move during the night it just sits there, I love being able to see friends and family,All the pictures you allow  its great. I see some changes could be made to the set up of the display pages and sides where we look for friends does not work the friends list for me is not complete. When I search for friends like alastair sargent who is my son in law there was no match I dont get it.Need to improve. But thanks for facebook.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This current version of the app is so slow! If you try and refresh the news feed to actually view 'most recent' stories the app just stalls and hangs and leaves you viewing the same stories you've seen the last 10 times you've opened the app! Also photos + their comments are always 'loading' but never actually 'load'...very annoying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
At the end of its life I say, I closing mine down due to privacy and the YANKS spying and fb being so weak to say NO	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Does Facebook have a new format on iPhones? my friend just updated his fb app earlier and his fb format looks diff than mine (his format looks new). Is this a bug or something?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everyone who hates it. Forget you it's amazing. I haven't had a problem with it crashing one bit (Maybe u all hate it because u have the iPhone 3GS) the hardware on the old iPhones can't handle the software the new Facebook has so maybe u people need to buy new phones! (I'd prefer the 4S or the 5) so u guys shush up and get new phones. Now I will admit it can crash sometimes but I honestly don't have a problem with it. All they need to do is in the next update, they need to allow the messaging bubbles outside the app and into the Home Screen and all the other 800,000 apps out there. So I won't have to leave the app I'm currently on and go to Facebook just to reply to my friend I'm messaging.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This most recent update is much cleaner and more user-friendly than it was in the past, but STILL NO LANDSCAPE VIEW AVAILABLE (except in photos). WHY? Is it beyond the developers' capabilities? So many people have asked for this simple feature, but you ignore the requests and then expect good ratings?(21-06-2013)*****Seriously? Another update and you still won't bring back landscape view despite countless people's requests? You used to have it, so it's possible. Maybe it's time to hire some new developers.(06-11-2012)*****So many people asked to have the landscape view brought back. Another update and still this isn't fixed. Why not? It's time consuming and frustrating to use, now. Disappointed.(22-09-2012)*****This is actually a REALLY good update - the best yet - but there's one thing missing: there's no longer a landscape view available. I have always turned my iPhone sideways as it makes it a lot easier to type this way, but this option is no more, and I now have a cramp in my arm as a result. If you can bring the landscape option back, I'll give you five stars. :)By the way, it's SO much better without the photo tags showing up all the time, and the updates are excellent! Really pleased overall. Thanks!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

I remember when Facebook just came  out. I mean everybody at the time was using MySpace. We all left their and went to Facebook, and it was great to begin with. But yeah.... Everything has changed, We started following twitters example with hashtag, Facebook only had one original idea and it was Facebook. Don't get me wrong I love Facebook it's a good way to stay connected but still. I will say this and then I'll shut up, I really like how now you can do feelings. And if your notifications keep popping up just go to your settings and turn it off to where doesn't show how many notifications you have. It gets less annoying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

When loading the news feed it doesn't give the status' in order. At the top will be from yesterday and as I scroll down il have ones from 5 minutes ago. Very annoying. Very slow when loading. When loading the application open it just closes for no reason then doesn't let me reopen for the next 2/3 attempts. Awful	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
WHY did you remove the availability to share from your feed to a group? grrrrr The app is easy to use but you keep changing things and taking useful things away. STOP IT! Being able to play all the games on mobile that one plays on the full site would be nice. Because you took away something I liked, I took away a star.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada

Your updates are crap. You constantly add and change things but never actually FIX anything. I wish I could give you NO STARS!This app crashes and force closes randomly.

The worst update yet. When commenting on my own posts or others posts the comment disappears right before my eyes when I press post button. Ridiculous. Also what was so wrong with having a friends list that was in alphabetical order. Why should I have to do a search for my own friends in my own friends list. When a photo is tapped for full view it's really glitchy & not a smooth change. Quite annoying actually. App randomly crashes on iphone 4s with latest software update.These are my main issues with app that I can remember at the moment. You've really lost the plot this time. 0 stars is way too high.

Amazing. I use Facebook everyday but it would be nice if we were able to see what our friends post, and what the pages post, on like some sort of different timeline. Or have a tab for friends posts and one for the pages that we like. I miss what my actual friends post because the pages post too much. That is my only issue and besides the games, that is it.Love, this frequent and forever user.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I do not like that I cannot set my default view on my iPhone to Most Recent. You guys need to consider fixing that.  Also, I have noticed that when I share something, my most recent timeline removes a large portion of things that were just there. I have to be sure to go all the way back to the last time I looked at Facebook or I miss the chance to see many updates (about 12 hours worth of info disappears).	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm sure we will all get used to the bottom navigation bar, but this constant crashing of the app is unacceptable. Also, when I am scrolling through my feed, it will randomly just back to the top. Sometimes I've scrolled through DAYS of posts, and when it jumps tithe top 1) I lose my place and 2) my phone has to reload all pics/vids and links! What's more is, Facebook seems to be taking extra long to load pictures and other content.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I like being connected socially and this app fills that need. I don't find a lot of bugs with it despite how many times I'm prompted to update the app. Then again I'm not doing a lot of posting or sharing just a lot of Facebook creeping.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
C'est vrai	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Work in the issues especially with pulling up and closing pictures	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Every time I open Facebook it either closes or doesn't load. When im writing someone it close down and delete the messages. It's always closing on. I'm having to reopen it. A lot. It makes me not even wanna use this app. This needs to be fixed and fast .	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love that y'all did the emotions now with the iPhone app. Just need to get the event page more up to date like the Mobile app. You can't edit it from the iPhone app. I still have to go to the desk top or mobile app to do a lot of things	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
it was great., it's getting better and better! hOpe On the next update we can use the videO chat.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
The chat system is really annoying. The app also constantly crashes and won't load properly.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
This app keeps bumping me off when I'm on it it will freeze and shut off and send me to my phone's main app menu  it's slow in updating the news strip	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Since the last Facebook "upgrade", I find it impossible to navigate pages or receive updates in a timely matter.  Add to that the constant crashing, I'd give this the worst review I have ever written.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Like the title says	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
No sounds with notifications. Every time I share anything and I have my newsfeed on most resent it resets itself, goes back to the newsfeed default and goes back to the top of the page! Very frustrating!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it..!.. It's great company. Slow sum times,but it's great.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Y'all doing an alright job but I hear about a lot of other people having problems their is a few things y'all should fix but I can't say that much I don't much problems everyone and then so y'all ok	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Only a few crashed but no freeze ups...at least not yet. I haven't had the chance to use of the new things that it said were added yet.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
You have taken a wonderful product and transgressed into the lap of tyranny! You sensor , you spy and your in bed with the NHS, IRS AND EVERYONE ELSE that is destroying our constitutions rights as Americans.... Spy on the ones that write right to left in squiggly lines...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's getting worse says I have like 11 notifications and I only have one it takes forever to load its lame sometimes even with my wifi at home the mobile site works better	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Bug fixes??? How about bug infestation? I've had to delete & reload FB from my phone 3 times in 2 days. It won't load. For the love of all things good & lovely in the world.... Fix it then leave it alone! We don't need updates every other day.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Loading speed is much much faster than the last few versions. I can finally use the Facebook app on my iPhone 4 again!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Seems to be much of the same we're all used to with no new features to excite us but reliable nonetheless.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
App. Has never given me problems if someone complained.  They need to get a life.  My life isn't the best but its got to be better than your crying butt	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Got the update and it crashed everything. Can't get anything back. Way to go Facebook!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I don't know what's going on with the new updates to Facebook mobile devices (iPad & iPhone), but I think they are the pits. Response time is slower than before. Is there a way I can go back to the previous version? We can no longer delete messages from mobile devices? I actually liked that feature.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Keeps crashing when I'm chatting, sometimes it crash while checking notifications... Please fix! It used to work perfectly for iPhone 5	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Previous update took away landscape mode, this one screws up timeline order. I just access thru safari.  Lol guess I'll just add on to my previous review. Now it takes forever to load and constantly asks me to set up push notifications. Also still no landscape mode	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since Last Two Weeks, It Doesn't Even Load! NOTHING! Log Off And Took Me A While To Log In And STILL DOESN'T LOAD! I Hate This Crapy App! V_V  Can't Belive This! Apple Developers! V_V They Should Be Ashamed!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My news fees won't update. And yes Facebook I am connected to the Internet.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app keeps crashing about every minute even after the new update! This is extremely frustrating especially when I am typing a message to a friend. Also, ADD LANDSCAPE MODE!You guys are horrible app developers!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have fun with Facebook 24-7. The application will close for no reason at times. :0	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The Facebook App for my iPhone 4S works perfectly!!!  I am on Facebook a lot!! Yep! I'm a Facebookaholic! 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Seriously... Constant issues with this app. If its bad enough for me to write about it, especially leave a review,  then it's bad. Come on guys, this company is loaded, you can't do any better than this? I know technical difficulties happen, but this has been far too long. I'd give it 0 stars but it won't allow that (go figure), so 1 it is I suppose.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am a FB lover but I think u should incorporate those little face icons that u provide for private messaging Lao we don't have to try n use symbols to make smilie faces o hearts	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Since the update, it hasn't worked properly in my iPhone 5 or my iPad 3.  Just keeps loading but nothing happens or updates.  Fix it fast FB!!! Such a disappointment.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I get on the Facebook App, it crashes. Ill be on it for a few minutes then it freezes and closes. It does the same when I try to share a photo through a message. It keeps crashing!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I sure wish this lousy app would stop crashing every time I try to open it. I'm better off using safari.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
getting better and better.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
This app is total garbage and has been since cover photos started.  Get it together Zuckerberg!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This app is brilliant but the updates seem pointless as they don't solve the biggest problem which is if you scroll too fast down your newsfeed or even click on a Facebook profile that it has difficulty in loading it will just cut you off, which is annoying when your half way through reading or commenting and it puts you back to your newsfeed :(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Great app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app is great now! Now they jus need to fix the messenger app -_-	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It doesn't sort the likers by time as before!!! 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes constantly after updateEDIT: crash was fixed long ago, but most recent update is a design horror. Stay away!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The process of searching a new friend and a new page is too slow!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Doesn't let me see comments and crashes every other time I open it. The updates keep making it worse. I have resorted to just using safari.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes constantly when messaging on my 4s. Hangs periodically. Takes way too long to load from the lock screen.The new update doesn't fix any of the above bugs, but adds the "feature" that messages sometimes won't open at all.Aren't you supposed to know how to do this app development thing, Facebook?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I think the app is pretty good.  It occasionally forces itself closed, but it starts right back up.  It's easy to log-in and out if needed.  I like that I can open links right in the app without my Internet pages opening, but I do wish it was more clear on which arrows control the navigation of the link and which take me back to Facebook.  Otherwise, it works great for me!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
New update sinks!!!!!! I can't update my "most recent" newsfeed at all, (its constantly trying to update, but to no avail) can't see any new notifications, I can't see my own posts or page!! Even uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times, updates once then no more "new" stories...until I shut off my phone or uninstall and reinstall!!!!:( fix this ASAP!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very Good :))	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
How are you going to market an app for such a huge audience and have it not even work? Constantly crashes, never loads new stories, freezes 9 times out of 10 when I push any button or swipe. This is on a brand new phone that every other app works brilliantly on. I could write a better app when I'm drunk. Delete	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The last 2 updates just made it worst. It crashes every 5 mins or so. When u share omething it takes u back to the top of the page. Its really annoying. Gotta fix this app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Have tried about fifteen times to update this app but it keeps telling me there's an error message. No matter what I do to try to make it work, now I can't use this at all. Stop the constant updates and give us something consistent that's going to last a while. Also, get rid of the bubbles when someone sends us a message. The simple numbers at the top of the screen were all we needed.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I find that using the mobile version is very limited. It seems to crash or freeze quite a bit too. Still love it. Keep improving please.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Don't understand the really negative reviews, this app works beautifully for me and I've never had many problems with it. The only thing that holds back the extra star is that the security features on the app still don't fully match the browser version, which is a bit annoying. But otherwise, it's great!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Starting to crash, lag and not refresh!!! Horrible	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very nice & beautiful FACEBOOK	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The last updates make it extremely hard to view your newsfeed. As soon as you share something, it automatically scrolls up to the top. Meaning, you have to start over again, and again, and again. Absolutely assinine!Between the above and the frequent crashes, it's very difficult to use.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest update brought things to a screeching halt. News feed and status updates moving at a snails pace. I can walk to my office and log into my computer faster than navigating the app. Please fix this!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I always get blocked by Facebook when I send out requests to people I know or people are related to me by marriage. Wished this would stop. If I didn't know the person then I wouldn't send any requests.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Good update	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Mohammed	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Don't try to force me to add a picture to my status update.  That's why there are two separate options.  SMH..  Scrolling is painfully slow.  And no option to edit a comment or status, just delete it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why oh why do you keep forcing Top Stories down our throats?! Bring back the default Most Recent setting please!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook you're clearly ignoring customers request to update your app.The whole week when trying to open app it constantly closes never opening at all!! WHY? PLEASE FIX APP FACEBOOK!!!!!!!!Still doing it!! Plus horribly slow to move thru app. If not fixed in the next two days, will surely remove and possibly close out account.June 19, 2013Update: Still closes when trying to open app. Still closes at any given time while on site.

I signed up for Facebook back in may 2013 and I friended e Rey one I know and some celebs and I just love Facebook cuz it lets you talk to friends who have moved and talk to celebs for tips how to get famous lol anyway it lets you meet new people online of course but the thing I really love is that it was created to let people talk to each other and say u friended some girl or boy on Facebook and they moved to your school but didn't know you lived there and there u go u have another friend who has known u online and now can get to know u more without having to keep typing what's your fave color or kind of dress I just love why Facebook was created cuz it's just so fun I'm on it all day and a little at night but any its just so cool ps I'm friends with Ross lynch from Austin and ally	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Besides when looking at pictures, when you click on them they zoom in and lose the edges. Also app closes regular on its own	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
If only there were an option for NO STARS!....it doesn't show all the feed! Had to get on the computer to see things that haven't shown up in the app! That defeats the purpose! AND recent feed is never recent!App ALWAYS has sucky updates! Get it together!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Quit updating it! Has not worked well for the last 5 or so updates!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok. It's nicer to open FB app than to log in all the time in Safari. Why did the "Share to Group or Page" option suddenly disappear?! Normally I'd give leeway to an app, but FB is now FULLY integrated into the iPhone itself. Keep up. Seriously.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app keeps crashing just about over it already.Fix bugs or I'm uninstalling what sense does it make to have it if cant use it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
So every time Facebook is open and I get a mail or notification it freezes then fully shuts down the app and takes a few moments to load again. Constantly freezes and crashed upon trying to launch app. When the app is closed it'll tell me I have a random number of notifications (for example it'll say I have 20 notifications when I have 2mails.) chat freezes. Videos never upload upon first try, if they do upload at all that is.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Used the new update for 4 minutes; the app crashes once and I am no longer able to see when people have replied to comments on pages I follow.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Finally a good working update i love it	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Not sure if this new release coincided with receipt of my new iPhone but I had no issues on my old one like I have on this new one. I've had to uninstall and reinstall several times and unlink from my hotmail account. Not happy :(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
FB used to be so fun and fast to work with. Now with all the new updates lately it is so so slow. People now have so much fun to block you from seeing or commenting when ever they desire to, and that took all enjoyment out of FB for me and others I know. I get knocked off and have to restart and sometimes have to even sign in again. It even drains my battery just waiting to open a notification or any other pages of my FB sites. It doesn't get much better, just gets worse where now I don't even like much of evening looking at FB anymore. All the fun has gone out of it. I keep having to delete my app and download again just to pick up some speed on it, then within 10 minutes its so slow again.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Never know what will appear on newsfeed. There is no consistency with what appears. Posts change every time I open, keeping in the same sort mode. Do the developers actually test their product before releasing the version. YOU NEED TO REVERT and go back to the old version.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Update: Seriously, why wont the news feed stay in the mode I choose until I decide to change it? EVERY time I go back to the app I have to choose "most recent." Although even that isn't working well; "most recent" currently has a handful of posts from the past 20 minutes and then jumps to five hours ago. "News feed" just jumps all around in time. Going back to Safari for now. Love the new look and the choices for news feed. But please quit reverting back to what appears to be your idea of the most important posts. If I choose "most recent," I want it to stay there until I change it. Why you would use "top stories" is beyond me; it ends up showing me the same posts I saw hours ago over and over. Should be "most recent" by default; that's the only way to be sure you're seeing everything you want to see. Especially annoying when you're trying to keep up with news posts during breaking news. There is also an annoying delay in loading the news feed choices, so when I scroll up to change to most recent, I end up clicking on something I didn't mean to and have to go back and choose it again. Wasting a lot of time with this new setup.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is so/so u can't copy the text, fascist book (facebook) censors posts, sanctions u if u friend to many people, post to too many groups whom u belong. Subscribes to politically correct nonsense as a way to censor or shut u down! It's an FBI dossier information gathering system. I only use it to get the word out.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It's okay. As the other may have said some bugs and lots of crashing, but I would like to be able to wright and watch a video at the same time, hide the noise when I receive a message, maybe even tag some people who are not in my friends list. I'm not the only one with ideas but I still think Facebook can become better.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I like what all I can do on my iPod Touch 3G. (Y) Tho bcoz of little storage my iPod hasn't completed the update to iOS 6.1.3 I believe is the latest update I do experience slow loading & blurry pics bcoz of slow loading I guess then there's the crashing issues. Also I notice I receive what looks like a small percentage of my news feed compared to a PC if that's normal but I do like the updated features they've become more convenient & simple looking forward to even more of an experience of what all I can do on my iPod. :)	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I hate the fact that I chose to have resent activities show when I open not some news feed. I get tired of having to change it. This app is really not that good. Take time out to listen to the people who writes you reviews, that way you will no we are unhappy.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

App throws you out. Long times to load photos.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not only does this app crash continuously, but the functionality is very confusing and poorly thought out.-Notifications get "stuck" in that you sometimes have a mystery number on the icon. -Sharing web addresses in chat window is shaky at best as the sometimes don't send or show up, leading you to ask the recipient if they actually got it. -Setting up photo albums and editing them is nearly impossible.-Timeline updates are very unreliable as well, randomly hiding posts or posting out of order.-Organizing friends is also difficult, and removing someone from favorites is done automatically rather than something you can control.-Double listing for "other friends"You are better off using the browser on your mobile.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Will not open or load. The only reason at all that I still have this app is because you do not have competition. A total disappointment. Spend less time adding things that slow the app down and more time making it simple to use. I don't need to run actual Facebook I have a computer for that keep it simple stupid!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

What is extremely annoying is the app will tell me I have 12-13 notification, but when I go to it, I only have 1-2.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Every single time I go into my inbox and start writing a message, 3/4 times I get halfway through a massive paragraph message and the entire app just closes and I lose my message! Make it save the message automatically!The "sent at xx" is really annoying, every time I click the sidebar it says I have a message and I have to go through everything to find out if I actually do and it's just really frustrating to deal with "sent" "sent" every single message I need to check.The "most recent" is all I want it set to, not every single time I have to click all of them to get rid of the 20+ on "News Feed", "Top Stores" and usually "Most Recent" shows top stories, so you have to close out and re-open.The chat bubbles, worst idea yet... They constantly bug out, if you click to open them they sometimes open and close and vice-versa, the limit is 4? Why not have them loaded down the side so you can have more than that?Everything else with the app is okay, there's no editing option for photo captions, shouldn't be too hard to add right?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Loving the new update which lets you add an emotion or what you're doing. Still not liking that I can't use it if I turn the screen. It use to rotate with the phone and now it doesn't.

First off, I have an awesome Iphone 4 and have zero issues with it. Ihated the updates so much due to their lack of compatibility that I deleted it all together. This app crashes at the click of anything from messaging, adding photos, leaving comments to simply scrolling through the news feed. I am currently downloading it again to verify whether or not its the updates onto the old app and if it betters with a new download all together.  We shall see but I'm truly not optimistic as this app has epically failed worse and worse following each update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Their is still bugs it the app I sometimes can't click on a picture to look at it. It crashes sometimes. Fix it	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Takes longer to load, quits more often, crashes my iPhone which the prior version never did. FB, your moron quotient continues to rise. It's just a poor company (as far as quality is concerned). What keeps me using it is my amazing friends. I wish it were easy to go back to prior versions of this crappy app.Oh yeah--PPPPPLEEEEEEASE BRING BACK LANDSCAPE MODE!!! OMG! Not all of us have hands the size of bread loaves!!!Thanks for listening. <kicks dirt>	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
STILL having these problems. It is beyond frustrating. ‰Û¢ Every time I share a post I am scrolled to the top of my newsfeed and switched back to "Top news". ‰Û¢ I have to manually switch my newsfeed to "Most recent" EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I open the app. Very, very disappointed Facebook.Really wish you would work on current problems before introducing new content and creating new problems =\(On a side note.. I am really happy that "feelings" etc can now be added to statuses via the app. But a little disappointed at the very small amount of feelings available and the inability to create your own with an emoticon you choose.. )	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Crashes and browsing pictures is hell	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

You need to get rid of the faces on my phone when I message someone, it is so annoying to have that face floating around my screen, I just can't stand it!!!I can't stand the fact that every time I open my fb, it goes to top stories, I click "most recent", why does it not Denver that was where I was???	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update from 6/19 slowed Facebook down immensely. To the point where I can't even use it because nothing will load. Please fix.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I open it automatically closes. Then I try to open a picture and it takes a long time to load. You have way to many updates all the time. Design it one way and leave it. Go back to the old Facebook. It's a lot faster.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I never review apps. I find the process tedious. But for this stupid app I will make an exception. FB is a necessity but they can't seem to get something as basic as their app correct right now. It crashes constantly. It drives me nuts. It will crash mid-conversation. It will crash when uploading a photo. Forget trying to take a photo via the Facebook app. Crashes. Want to post on a friends wall? Nope. Sorry. Crash. Stupid. Fix these things before making the app fancier and more liable to crash stupid FB.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's good. Needs to be less drama and less people making fake profiles. And less hacking	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

This isn't Facebook on your mac, this is an application on something smaller then a matchbox. Great job facebook(p.s giving the app 1 star actually makes it harder for them to meet your standards, irony at its best)	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
I use FB for news and other articles and the screen stopped the rotation feature some time back and that means I can no longer expand the text to a size my 65 year old eyes can read. As a result I turn to Twitter as their screen still rotates to landscape allowing expansion of the text.The sort feature doesn't work as it once did. It sorts itself to most popular but my interest is most recent. My daily status posts sometimes take several hours to days to appear and then they are one right after the other. Pages used to be easy to find and follow but with the changes I haven't been able to find new pages I'm interested. Fortunately, so far, new pages are also on Twitter so can read them there.Searching for individuals has also become more complex and frustrating so I've given up.I'm getting more and more ads from companies themselves or posted by friends. Typically 3 businesses will be grouped in one status update. Sometimes a friend's name will be listed as making a recommendation of the biz or product but this makes no sense as some are not in the area in which my friends and I reside.And then this thing of 'XYZ may post on your behalf' is ridiculous. I'm 100% able to post myself. Why would I want someone else do it for me?Facebook should just drop the mobile app and stick with the computer. FB has lost to Twitter.March 2013: Considering dropping FB completely.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Whenever I open it up it just crashes, I have to do this a few times before it finally works on my iPod however I've recently purchsed an iPad mini and it works much better but still slow and takes ages to post pictures from your library. I think it's better to use Facebook on safari	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Constant crashes since last update!! Sooo irritating! I can't view my profile without it crashing. & when I'm on my newsfeed it is constantly sending me back to the top on its own. Can't view pictures or videos. Ridiculous. 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Dragging The Bubbles Around Has Made The App VERY Unique! I Love That I Can Now Update What I'm Doing From Mobile, And The Appearance Of The App Is Flawless! But, I Entered My Name Incorrect And Now It Won't Let Me Change It To The Correct Spelling. Fix This Ill Surely Give It Five Stars And Recommend It To Everyone!(:	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Well, the last update stopped the crashing at the price of ALWAYS losing your place in the newsfeed when you come back. Want to look at that link more carefully? Do t do it if you want to stay where you're at in the newsfeed! It makes the app almost worthless.Facebook, the solution is simple: GET RID OF THE AUTOMATIC REFRESHING OF THE NEWSFEED!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

My issues. It says there are 11,15,10 notifications, I open it up, there's 2. Maybe 5. What the hell. Second. I can copy someone's comment, but not a post? Really? The whole idea is to be able to copy paste some of those FB chain posts "don't share, copy paste please". I would with a few I really like, but I'm not opening my freaking slow computer just to copy paste a status! Otherwise, pretty good in my opinion.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I hate it it stay messing up my phone	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a great app. It allows people to stay connected. Lets others be part of a special time. Should be more elderly-people-friendly. The easier to use the more people could enjoy it. Make it simple but have great features like hashtags so one could discuss desired topics. Thank you Facebook.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

It's been crashing way too much lately :/	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With every update and tweak they make, this application gets worse. I would have given it zero stars if that had been allowed.The worst is that the stories in the newsfeed were often different than in the "most recent" feed.Also, when I simply look at Facebook through the mobile site, I see many posts that I did not see through the application. So what's the point of having it, if it's not sharing items I'd like to view?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Completely worthless and unusable.  Not only has it not worked right for the past year, but it appears to be a danger to my phone. I downloaded the latest update. When I tried to use it and it locked up my phone. Was able to do a hard shut down. Thought it might not start back up. Not good.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is only my opinion, of course.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I use this app everytime I go on Facebook, I don't even use my computer anymore.It's easy to so use. I love being able to share pics, private messaging....  It's all so easy with this app.If you don't already have it, you should get it!!The only problem I have is, changing my cover picture. I can't do it from this app. If I could do that, I'd give the app 5 stars.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I recently got the app and it's crashes about 20+ a day on me. It's also really slow and can't take all the information which contributes to the crashing. Also, after the recent update, I don't get any of my messages when someone PM's me. It shows me notifications when I get messages, but when I check there's nothing. And when it does show, it comes around a half an hour or two hours at the most to send me my PM. It's really annoying because what's the use of having the app of I can't even use it :\?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This update looked excellent at first but now I recon it the worst one I lose comments, notification sounds for comments and only chat messages and it keeps resetting itself I wouldn't waste your time with it and losing comments this was good at first but now it a lot worse than all the other updates And I have to keep logging out then back in because u can not refresh status's like before a totally waste of time , DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!This app has slowed my iPhone down and causes it to crash the you tube app integrated in the Facebook app and it crashes my phone :-( and can not open messages as it causes the app to crash this app is getting worse and worse it needs sorting out big time and signs you out all the time , it keeps crashing when I try to view events to see who's birthday it is etc this app is getting worse and worse not better I would not waste your time getting it , I thought they would of at least brought an update to fix all these things that are now wrong with it  I find the FB app on iPhone has gone exactly how it used to be on a blackberry and now they have changed around and if the app didn't kill my battery so much on my blackberry I would most certainly be using that for the FB app as it so easy to use now like the app used to be like on iPhone but its turned into a joke on iPhone leg me tell you , now I can't even scroll back to see past posts from last night this app is getting worse and worse do not waste your time installing it, when are you going to repair the glitch when you try to open the events tab or you just going to leave it crash and send you back to the home screen ? Even crashes now when opening pictures needs sorting out big time !!!! Now missing even more comments , sort it out FACEBOOK!!!!!!! And I've just noticed that my pics that I once set to private are no longer private since update ! This app has so many things going wrong for it , I wouldn't waste you time it crashes all the time if u want to delete inbox messages it only lets u do it one at a time you can't change cover picture events feature in app crashes the app this app should of been left as it was years ago !! Total and utter garbage now !! :-( and need to install a comment removal back just like how it used to and an un follow function to, and did I say that you lose comments on status's should nvr of touched it and not try to fix something if it ain't broken!!!! This update that's just been released don't get it its complete and utter crap I'm glad I got a blackberry to use Facebook as the app for blackberry's is now like the way it was for iPhone before they started playing around with it , you lose comments , click on notifications then click on the notification and you see that people have liked you're comment which you can no longer view even tho you wrote it home page doesn't keep to same feed as you want it keeps changing to default , this app is getting worse and worse by the updates and it needs a unfollow tab in status's	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I like this app except for the fact that it keeps crashing on my first gen iPad... When it doesn't crash, it does provide for most of the features that I can get to from the full site; however, I find it EXTREMELY annoying that I Can't edit a post to a custom privacy from iPad app.  For instance if I post something to all my friends, and decide I want it to be all of my friends minus a group I have created, i got edit the privacy, but it WON'T bring up the window to select who I include and who I exclude.  You only have the option to use prechosen filters.  It is extremely annoying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I'm extremely disappointed with this latest update. I don't give a crap about adding "feeling happy" to my post when you take away the option to share from a mobile device to a page we manage.

Facebook where you can follow people you haven't seen in years, meet people that you never would have met otherwise, now I cannot imagine not having those people in my life. I keep track of what is going on in the town where I grew up. My brother lives in Japan when they have earthquakes I can know in minutes that he is ok. I love Facebook, I cannot imagine a time without it. I know it is not popular to love Facebook, but I really do. Is it perfect? Maybe not, but it is so much better then anything out there.

Seriously get your act together Facebook. This app is awful, randomly deletes my posts, takes forever to load and is just so buggy! How about scaling back adding new features until you get the basics right?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Great !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	New Zealand
I think the new update is great but the only thing is it becomes a little slow, if you could possibly make it so my iPod doesn't slow down with the update, and using the app, then it would be incredible. Otherwise great job	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The best!!!‰_Live this app,use it daily.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

My entire Facebook layout is completely different from your pictures, I've got a black menu bar across the bottom, why?!! IPhone 4S.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

My fb app keeps crashing like every 10min !!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't edit status updates. Can't delete status updates. I don't want to be told which stories are my "top" stories. I want to see every status update individually by ALL my friends and liked pages. I don't want them lumped together when they contain similar wording. It crashes. After it crashes I have to start all over.Also, Not very secure. Facebook "decides" which stories or status updates are "important". Some updates are stupid. Did I mention not very secure?! There are constantly warnings about loopholes that make your personal information less and less private and safe. If it weren't for trying to keep in touch with family I wouldn't use it. Still contemplating what steps I want to take to delete it. I want to save all my statuses first. Facebook needs to address its safety. Not be so vague. Write things in "English" that people can actually understand not in legal bill crap that makes no sense.I don't like that my photos can be saved by other people and shared. Facebook for me is a very personal and private place. I have a very limited amount of friends. I do it that way on purpose. I don't Like having apps and other people having access to my personal life. I refuse to link any game or app to Facebook. I avoid it at all costs. I don't want games suggested, I don't want to see games other people play. I don't want to see advertisements!!! The list goes on. I only use Facebook to keep in touch with family. If I have to I will seek alternatives. This just isn't safe. Or user friendly.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The only thing I like about the new Facebook is the stickers. I don't like how the messages stays on your screen until you delete your message. For some reason Facebook is keep on crashing on me when I am on it for a long time. I am getting tired of keep on getting Facebook bands because of I am adding my friends on Facebook and then Facebook is saying I am adding people who I don't know andI am not adding people whoI don't know. I am keep on getting 30 day bands from adding people and I am getting tired of it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
It won't even install! When I updated it, it just wouldn't load and its been 2 days!!!! 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is insane!!! How can you launch an update for an app and it doesnt even fix the crashing	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I don't like that when I updated the Facebook app, every time I went on Facebook after that, I would be kicked out. Or it would freeze, or not look at a photo, or load any of them. Facebook crashes still.....	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Rather than just saying "bug fixes", please actually fix the important bugs.Why this app still can't remember the fact that, every single time I start it up, I have to specifically say that I want my news feed in "most recent" order, is beyond me.It's an easy fix. Seriously...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

The new auto correct feature is rubbish, it tries to correct from the first letter typed and forces the correction if you continue typing:-). The app gets worse with each update! And you cannot revert to a previous version so avoid! Not content with forcing advertising into our feeds they now add features that are unnecessary and make the app too complex:-(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Crashbook back at it again ! As soon as the app starts working decently. You try and develope something else dumb . That doesn't help the progress of the app. But it holds it back from all the other competition ... Which to me makes no sense at all! If there were another app to used if so get it .

Before the latest update I would have rated higher, but now I am not getting all my newsfeed items & when I refresh or "update" my current newsfeed items double...then triple. Irritating...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Excellent!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes!! But I do like the new look	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It won't update when you open the app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Thanks just keep on proving & no spying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
When I have fb open, and I click on something, it closes and this happens multiple times before I can reopen with out problems.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I keep losing scores in my game apps like candy crash and my Facebook page is very slow loading, also I get a lot of spam	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
New version freezes and is non-responsive 45% of the time. Plus it closes and re-opens when it wants to.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook is getting boring :-(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Still needs some minor fixes, but love the newest version.I would like to be able to put the chat stickers in comments and status updates.Restoring the landscape view would be nice as well.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Ever since photo uploading has been enabled through the web browsers, I no longer have any use for this app - especially with the lag, crashes and missing chunks of time on the newsfeed. And at least with Safari or Chrome you can still access the desktop site, which is useful for more refined tasks like organizing photo albums.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
As soon as I did the update, I could not see anything. Had to delete app and downloaded it two times! It just keeps getting worst :/ it so bad that I am now using the site instead is the app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm loving everything about the app so far honestly I have nothing to complain about or mention that this needs to improve. Keep up the good work	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app keeps closing all the time!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Overall, I like the app. However, I would much prefer to be able to change my profile back to the old view rather than this timeline. We've had it for a while now and I still hate it. It looks very disorganized and I would prefer to have it how it used to be.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The update didn't do anything significant nor helpful. Pictures won't display at all.  Also, please find a way to collapse the chat bar. Thanks.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes all of the time. Only will post comments sometimes. Frustrating JUNK.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Has a lot of crashes and screen freezes several times a day. Drives me batty	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
There needs to he the same capability in the app as there is outside of it for being able to select for specific audiences when posting status updates. If I want to post a status update but hide it from only a few people, I can't unless I want to select for an entire group, which doesn't help in most cases. It would be great to add the option to hide a status from a select few people from the friends list. I'm surprised this hasn't even remotely been addressed yet, as this is one of the key features of Facebook.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is incredibly slow and not showing any pictures because it is "loading." Needs an update!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I oft times wonder why Facebook keeps booting me off! Gets really frustrating. Really wish you guys could fix all the glitches that keep cropping up.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
You fixed two of the three things I complained about!  Changing the cover pics and the ability to post to other's walls!  Third thing is to be able to change the friend settings where we choose the settings for individual friends; show in newsfeed, their updates, whether we want to see status updates, photos etc.  thanks!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
At first I thought it might be just my phone, but reading the other reviews I know that it's not. I have the same irritating issues. Having to openThe app just for it to close. Then re open it, then reopen it. And when I click on certain things it takes FOREVER to load. I'll be in the middle of a comment and the app just closes on me while I'm typing.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
After reading other comments I know realize it's not my phone it's facebook problem not mine. Thanks review for clearing this up.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I find Facebook getting better and easier just wish it didn't crash all the time when I'm messaging people other then that it's fast and easy to connect to the world and people who say its slow or lag it's ur provider and or devise ? Don't blame software for your hardware problem	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I enjoy using Facebook , could use a little less political stuff	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
For the most part this app does what I need it to do.  Does crash every now and then.  And I am not a fan of the annoying bubble message thing, but its not a huge deal.  I use it frequently so it can't be all that bad, right?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes all the time, is slow to update, hangs.A perfect example of how to break an app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook for the phone is one of the best inventions since sliced bread but the updates keep confusing me!!! I just get used to one way and now it's changed!!! I prefer the menu along the bottom btw!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Your fb app so stuck!!! Why??? Fix it plz...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I wish we could get the old FB back. I'm tired of seeing people on my feed that I don't know just because a friend commented on it. I never even see some of my friends post. Only the same ole people. Really not happy with it at all anymore and have considered more than once deleting my account.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Little steps to improve here and there, like improved tagging, but for every thing fixed something else is missing, unreliable or made worse. The floating button for a new message and having to drag it down the screen to close it? If you're bored and looking for things to do, there are plenty of features missing I'm sure we'd all love to have on our phones that we don't.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great app easy way to be on Facebook without carrying my laptop everywhere few minor bugs but what app doesn't !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

Well...I spoke too soon the last time. Sure there are "better" features but it means nothing when the app crashes continuously. Smh...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
At least this one doesn't crash EVERY single time on startup like the previous two versions did. Using this update on my iPod Touch 4th Generation running iOS 6.1.3.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I like it. But why can't I share anything to the page I administrate? I could do that before. Other that that, I like the update. But the "share" is a problem for me.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I do hate how the app will say I have 10 notification than I open the app and it's really only 2! That's annoying!!! It's freezing when you open pictures Again Annoying!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Got to continue to improve. All improvements make me more comfortable using FB.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I really enjoy Facebook, mostly the games cause it seems like that Facebook has been known to cause relationship problems....(Not FB's fault, just another way to lie and cheat), seems like with EVERY update it only gets worse. U have to open the app several times to get it to work. Maybe instead of adding more features u need to fix the problems, then add more things. Like now I will have notifications and have to reopen FB several times to actually see them. Fix the flaws please before adding anything more....!!!! Thanks	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

The latest update has made my chat not work I have to go into my messages and send from there... Very inconvenient!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
There is alot more you can do with the app (such as how you upload pics), rather than going online normally through your phone, but there is also some things you can't do on the app. You can't see people's bdays with the app and you can't get to your "other" folder for messages. And sometimes the app shuts down on its own or freezes up while searching for pages. You guys need to improve this app more. Thanks.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Since the last update - it doesn't load at all. Needs to be fixed!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app runs veeery slow. You've added mis-optimized features that makes my iPad 3 struggle in lagging. Also "bubbles" crash everytime. What is wrong with you?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I dont like it. Sometimes when i post, it doesnt show up on the news feed, only on my wall. The GIFT thing is absolutely dumb!! My friend purchased a gift for me in march, still havent gotten it. Also what happened to the option when we like a page, to be able to either show their post in our feed or get notified? I want to like more pages, but im a mom & dont want my kids to see it. Its only for 18& older.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Status updates are sometimes missing never to be seen only to be viewed on individuals walls. No consistency/continuity in wall posts,  slow & at times unresponsive, advertisements are annoying & unwanted. Facebook's privacy is questionable. Pictures are taking eons to load. The app is unstable. Getting seriously bored. I miss who they where and dislike who they now are.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This Facebook app has always had problems, but now it won't even open or load. I'd rather use the browser.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Always on here and such a useful thing to have	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
App crashes multiple times before opening. Then runs and runs and runs to open a pic. Don't like my news feed having a limit to how far back it will let me see posting history. I do like some of the new features, but the loading time makes it hard to notice the good things. Also wish there was a way to get rid of the message bubble when done chatting with someone as it blocks my view.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest version update: Verdict?  App still shuts down randomly. Pretty consistently when viewing photos. ------UPDATE: Have to drop to 1 star due to the amount of times the app just quits. I now type in 1 sentence updates/comments. OR, I have to do a select all and copy just in case it quits on me so I can restore what I was typing. Fix that and I can evaluate the app with a logical state of mind versus emotional. -‰ÛÓ-UPDATE: I have more issues with the app quitting when viewing photos, posting photos. Quite annoying. ----Occasionally the app quits when trying to view a photo (actually, that is the only time it throws me back to home page). The comments...*sigh* for the love of everything that is holy, please just FIX the comments on posts. Missing comments, comments out of order, all of it. Just fix it. Is there no UAT for the fb app at all?!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Previous Review: I like everything except the fact that I can't share post & I can't @tag friends in my post & commentsThe above comment was from a few months ago. Now that I can share post & tag friends I love the app. I've always liked fb & this app just makes it easier to communicate with my fb friends & family.. LOVE IT!6/20/2013I like the latest app upgrade. Lots of new things to enjoy. But is there a reason why the developers will not make the app so that it goes into landscape mode?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I have always loved my FB app. However, the last several times I've updated to the more "up-to-date" version, it seems to get slower and slower. My news feed takes forever to reload. I can also forget searching for anything, or looking at a specific friend's page. I could be there forever waiting before that happens. Getting more and more disappointed with it as more time goes by. Also, when I pull up my friend list, the alphabetical option is gone from the side. If I want to browse, I have to start at the A's every time. It's rather annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I miss FaceBook's landscape support. Also, trying to view photos is just ridiculous. The photo takes forever to view, trying to view the whole photo is awkward because of the little information box that is there, and closing a photo requires about a ten second wait. I may opt for the browser app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The app is really good but sometimes when I view pictures it freezes and other times its very slow. The only part I don't like is if I want to delete comments I use ton able to just slide and delete, it won't happen now :/.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have problems from time to time. Trying to get someone to help is difficult. Sent emails etc with no reply. Haven't had anything major for awhile but it's ok.... It works when it works and when it doesn't well let's just say it gets boring :-(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Crashes often, screen freezes frequently, buttons tend not to work half the time. All new and added feature are pointless and only seem to slow the app down to the point it's almost useless.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love Facebook it's very entertaining	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I was asked to review Facebook. I was introduced to Facebook by my adolescent daughter years back. I enjoy the fact that I can reconnect with old real friends, and that I have made some new virtual world friends. I enjoy posting pictures, sharing items etc. however, I very much dislike getting notification saying that such and such has invited me to play slot mania, or any other annoying game, and when I click on that notification, I am taken to the App Store. That needs to be eliminated. That's an invasion of my privacy. I a, very careful about the pictures that I post, or the comments that I write. But, I do have serious concerns about my privacy on Facebook. I don't know who's controlling what, where, and when. In addition now if you want to play words with friends, scrabble or even Bookworm, you are asked to sign in through Facebook. I receive invitations to games from my friends, only to realize that it's the games that are inviting me, not my friends. Scary!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the most recent update to the Facebook (FB) app i have run into some frustrating issues. I have been trying to upload a couple of pics to my FB page (made 8 attempts) and i still have not been able to successfully upload them b/c it indicates that the connection to FB fails or times out each time i try.  When i try to view friends' pages or tap to view pics i run into either really long waits for pics to show up/refresh or the FB app suddenly closes down for no reason. Hoping FB will be fixing these issues very soon.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The Facebook app adopted some retarded new bugs, ever since the last 2 updates the app now takes at least 30 seconds to load and close out of pictures. The other issue is that whenever I get a new message and open up Facebook app again, it takes forever to load only to close out. Then takes forever to re-load the second time. I have 2 iPhones and its the same issues with the app on both	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I am giving this one star because I was able to download it and it did connect to my FB page. After that, it was downhill. The functions are so limited it's not worth using. In fact, I'm deleting it from my iPad. The updates do nothing to enhance the performance, and the bubble conversation is annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook inc. , for the next update you guys should put the people who liked the statues in order not random. Thank you !	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Why am I getting a banner every time I post saying "get instant updates about your recent post. Tap to learn how"??And why give me the option of posting a photo if I click status???If I wanted to post a photo I'd click photo!!!Zuckerberg needs slapping with a fish!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It's horrible since last update. It will crash several times while I'm writing a post or message, and I lose everything I had already typed! Please fix this. Thank you!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
You guys should add a cooking suggestion in the "what you doing" option	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Ever since some bizarro upgrade I was forced to do, all my abilities like sharing to my pages are gone. It's like the programmers were high that day on this version.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I see alot of users say it crashes.Not once on the 7 different devices i used in the past 6 years have i ever experienced fb crashing as an app.Obvi its the users device. Clear your cookies, cache & history from time to time and learn to ensure the app itself isnt running in your phones settings if your not using it.I learned to get used to fb changing all the time and theres nothing i cant do about it.I still miss version 1.2	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I'm 100% addicted....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Love connecting with people!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Don't know what I would do without Facebook keeps me connected with friends and family and meeting new people and sharing happy and sad moments with everyone ! Love to post pictures and get feed back whenever I need to ask questions ! It still has some issues every now and then but not many and they fix them as fast as they can !	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
No longer crashing all the time. Definitely a step up from the last three updates.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Facebook itself is a great social media site. The mobile app, however, leaves little to be desired. The postinga often do not mirror what is on the full site, specifically with regard to the news feed postings. Also, for some reason clicking on a picture to see it in full screen often causes a strange delay that makes it seem as if the app has frozen up. This is quite annoying to say the least. One day FB will spend more time and money on the app and make it much better.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It constantly crashes, really slow,  and it keeps un-liking all the pictures I liked!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This latest update is not good. It doesn't keep newsfeed up to date even when you tap new you have to tap multiple times to get up to date different from last looking at newsfeed...the chat bubble is more helpful-thank you! This update is slower!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
FaceBook for iPhone App AwEsOmE is the BEST SOCIAL APP!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Until somebody fixes the sounds and vibrate for notifications, which broke just before iOS6, it is still unacceptable. Too many updates have passed without fixing this to be overlooked.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
How come you can't alter custom settings on the app when you make a post, but you can on the mobile site? I've been waiting for *that* update forever!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I used to have a life.... Until someone told me to make a Facebook account :P xxxxx	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
You need to make it so that we can add a description with our profile pictures.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
It's help for all of people to keep in touch with others.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Good app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Latest "update" means that I have to keep installing and uninstalling just to get the app to load. And forget about posting anything. Nothing will post.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
For a week now on my iPad I have to constantly delete and again download app.  After a couple of times opening the Facebook app it will not finish updating newsfeed.  Please fix your app!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's not how I'd like it to be totally, but it's a great app to have for sure, just wish it ran a little faster!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Still suffers from poor performance and random crashes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
For some reason I can't reply to post. I write it out, push post. It is there then gone. Only happens on the mobile app. I I go the ought the Internet it is fine. Uninstalled and reinstalling to see if that helps.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I'm sorry to read all these reports of crashing. I have not had that problem. I enjoy the app and enjoy keeping up with old friends and new.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I like having Facebook on my phone. I just wish it didn't mess up so much	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I've had a Facebook for a while now. The new update makes me question the integrity of the whole site. I quite literally cannot do about 90% of the things you get a Facebook for. That includes even viewing my profile.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps getting better	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It does what everyone & anyone knows what it does	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Good social app!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Those chat head things are annoying on iPhone because the screen is small. They're fine on iPad mini and iPad. Facebook chat is also a bit slow to load long conversations. Brilliant otherwise - moved away from family and friends and its a great way to keep up with stuff.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Every time you get a notification for a message & you click to open it (the actual chat with the person you're talking to), it takes so long for the message to actually show up in the chat so you can't see the whole thing. Fix it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

The new version is very slow, crashes ocasionaly and takes long time to be opened. However, since the chat heads update everything started moving like an iced piece of poo. Ruins the whole experience. It runs slow and crashes a lot on both my iPhone 4 and iPhone 5. I do not recommend installing this version, as a matter of fact do not install any update, it's just a constant headache.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Newly updated app takes forever to update when accessing it for first time. Never did that before... :-(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
- Too slow to upload and or update- No copy/paste capabilities - Privacy settings too limited- Should be able to "share" on selected "friends" only- Mark Zuckerberg should be killed	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't share everything yet and I wish I could post to private msg for some things but overall, a good mobile experience.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This latest version is utter rubbish. I can't get it to stay open for more than 20 seconds before it crashes. Wish I could go back a version until you sort this s*** out.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It's I'd glitchy, awful. Everytime an update comes up Facebook only gets worse.. Fix the glitches. And leave it alone!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like Facebook, but there are things I wish I could do from my phone that I can't. For example, if I want to upload pics to an album in a group- nope! Really? How hard can that be to put on the app?Don't care for the picture bubble that pops up when someone messages me. It gets in the way and is no better than the old notification on the top of the screen. Other than that it suits my needs.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Really good & easy to use!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
YulpSure do	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes allot and freezes very disappointed	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Bring back the ability to share things to other friends walls and to groups. It was changed where you could share in the app to groups and friends walls. Now it's back where you can only share to your wall. Bring back the ability to share to groups and friends walls.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I use it all the time, virtually no problems	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I love FB! It's great, but wish it was a little easier to upload multiple pix in an album on my iPad. The only "glitch" I have found.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It would be great to be able to do all the same things with the mobile/tablet that you can with a desktop computer. Like edit your own comments after posting and being able to view photo albums in groups/pages you have.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Lags, barely works, outdated, typical Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Amazing	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Pretty solid app. Two suggestions; 1) allow for cover photo repositioning by double-clicking and holding the photo you wanted moved. 2) when commenting or posting, if the user's finger slips off the box the box goes away. Most times the writing is left in the field to continue but not always. This app is otherwise very worthwhile.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Let me start off with me saying I enjoy facebook at times. It's great for connecting with old friends, new friends, or just a pastime. Not on iPhone. It's a piece of junk on the mobile platform. Not only does it have an amateur layout and interface, it's slow, it lags, and worst of all, don't even think about looking at picture albums, because as soon as you scroll through pictures; black screen, pause, crash, back to the home screen. No matter how many "updates" they give this thing, it'll always be better to go on the internet, even with safari.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Over all works decently. Crashes every now and again on my perfectly fine iPhone 5. Also it will jump my newsfeed from where I left it off for my most recent. It's got really stupid inconvenient glitches	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Add Tubitxhyboutique!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Yay, I love Facebook! I recently deactivated my account because of embarrassing myself so much but a week later reactived it. I'd highly recommend it to anyone in the age bracket.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Not bad for what it is, another social networking medium. Miss the features of typing a name and place to try and find people we've known. Wish I could find them all.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
BS!! Keeps crashing! Dammit!!! Also the app icon looks bad. It was better when it had the grid with silver.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Good applicati	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm writing a review purely so that the developers might sort out the fact it crashes and shuts down all the time. Mostly when I'm writing messages, it's awful. I don't know what you have changed to make it do this more frequently but please fix it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Needs the glitches sorted out but I'm still impressed	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Like another review said it's more like crashbook not Facebook. It freezes or just takes way too long to update. Plus you can't keep the news feed in most recent. I'm missing posts and the posts I see are all out if order. I like my news feed to be in chronological order.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It crashes sometimes when I upload very small images, and usually says its unable to send. Also, rarely, the chat heads don't work. I'll click on a conversation and nothing happens. Also it pretty frequently says my session timed out and makes me sign in again. The black tags for names are confusing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
They fixed the crashes and according to your Internet its very fast at loading!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Love the updates, really upped their game. The bubbles for messages are cool. The layout works really well along with the gestures making it a beautifully smooth app to use with minimal crashing. Happy face booking!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Very useful. Please fix the following:I can't edit my albumI can't delete my post in my timelineI can't change or edit my picture caption.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

One thing I would request is the ability to delete or edit our status and comments. That's frustrating when you make mistake and have to go to laptop or computer to correct. Wish I could do on my phone	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

The new update ruined the app! It does not open at all. When you click on the app, it has a loading sign then crashes every single time. I have tried deleting and re-downloading over 10 times now, as well as updating my Software but nothing has worked. I have gone back to using Facebook on my computer because I can't even access from my phone with the new update. Facebook please fix this!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I do hate that it crashes. I also hate the talking bubbles. I just like the previous version better.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I access Facebook from my phone 99% of the time and find it extremely frustrating that I do not have access to all information on my page via my mobile device. Examples: when someone comments on a post, I would like to be able to read all comments, not just one or two that Facebook chooses. Additionally, I would like to view all of my email correspondences not just one I recently sent. Also, when I set preferences on my ap (such as: view most recent news rather than what Facebook has chosen or who I allow to see my posts), I would like it to keep those preferences until I change them (and not have to reset them periodically).	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Bravoooooo	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Possibly the worst app I've come across, I don't know what you've done in the last few updates but its getting worse and worse. Constantly crashes, full of sh1t adverts. Cripplingly slow. Basically a joke. Zuckerberg you obviously signed off on this garbage I suggested you put it where it belongs, in the trash!!!!Not even worth wasting your time on. Go to a pc or just use safari to view on an iPad instead. I wouldn't even give it a star only I can't leave a comment without doing so.Updated as of 23/06/2013Well done FaceArse it's still a steaming divot.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It's nice to have Facebook on the go but it crashes over and over again! It can crash at bad times, such as when creating an event meaning you can't get back to that exact location until you're at a computer later or you open the actual web page. They should stop adding stuff and iron out the insane amount of crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This Facebook app loves to crash too much. If you look at pictures for too long it crashes. I can't even add anything from my iPod touch without it crashing as just as I am tagging people. It is a wreck and needs to be fixed as soon as possible.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's ok just need some work. Every time I try to load the app, it crashes. Then some posts that I make never show up on the app but will on safari. The updates made Facebook worse.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Is really easy to post pics and comments on Facebook using this app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
You should really do something about this app because each time I try to open and see a picture it always crashes and then it crashes when I try opening it for the first time during the day 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Latest update is absolutely emptying my battery! This happens every time you send out an update, then I have to wait for a fix. How about testing your updates BEFORE sending them out?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Honestly, there are no words to describe this terrible app. They've put more effort into making it look nice than actually making it work! What a piece of garbage, trash, the list can go on! If I could give it no stars, I would. They don't even read these review, otherwise, we wouldn't be putting this app down so much.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This latest update is crap, I can only see posts 12 hours old and can't open messages, don't bother facebookers	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Like the chatheads but please let me log out on my iPad! It just keeps me logged in, even after clicking logout, confirming, closing the app and shutting the iPad off. Go back in and start up the app again, there I am logged in. Arrrghhh!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	New Zealand
But after making the mistake of updating last update before checking it out first.  DO NOT UPDATE LATEST UPDATE. Bad move. Check it out first Facebook before giving us all grief.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

The app is terrible.  Crashes and hangs up. Based on all the reviews I have seen. The recent "upgrade" is so terrible, I will not be on Facebook until the app is fixed..

Great app for almost all aspects of Facebook.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Fed up with slow loading and update notifications for suggested apps. Freezes and crashes regularly so that's one thing I can count on not changing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Won't stop force closing after 10 seconds on my iPhone 4. Absolutely worthless app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

1) Arbitrarily crashes. 2) Sends the user back to the top of their feed for no reason at random times despite what the user desires. 3) If I have a choice between using a computer or the app, computer wins 100% of the time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Much better!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Very good yes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It's Facebook cant go wrong with it the app is a wee bit slow but it's all good can live with that	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
SERIOUSLY?! Now I have to tell the app every time I refresh the feed to show me "most recent posts" instead of what Facebook thinks are most important to me?!!! Facebook, you're rushing yourself to an early obsolescence. It's always been a waste of time but now it's an annoying waste of time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Constantly crashes. When I post a pic or status from it it disappears. Shows up as content unavailable on regular FB page.  Seriously how hard is it to just have a mobile app that works???	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I was about to give it five stars until I downloaded the newest edition. It's very odd; extra unnecessary icons and such, and it orders friends weird when you look to view likes/comments (as oppose to listing them by time). Hopefully gets reverted soon.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The new version is cooler indeed. But it's just soooooo slow.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Yeah it's alright  I think we should be able to have the option to write our own relationship status though	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
The new version doesn't work on my iPhone at all!!! Terrible!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app has clearly been designed to maximise space used for advertising and wether or not it was a goal the app has suffered, the user interface is now slow and messy. The 'update' has made it worse and just confirmed that Facebook is not really for  the benefit of its users but its investors and is now more about advertising than a clean, fresh, app that I want to use. The chat bubble is pretty cool but I don't like how you can't minimise it easily. Very disappointed by Facebook, again. I think soon I will stop using it completely.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Talk about getting away with the bare minimum! The dev's are losers. Horrible. Need to connect with my PC or I only get 50% of the site. Dumb!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is great! On iPhone5 it never crashes it is fast and works great! If you app is crashing or not working maybe its you device or not enough wifi! I seriously wish mine crashed or was slow because I'm on it ALL the time!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

1- Way too much advertising!  2- Crashes and closes when clicking on links. 3- Why can I not edit on my iPad? I have to go to my laptop to edit!  4- I do like how the page displays so much better!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I hate this new version when people like your status you can see who liked it but  its not in order when you see it again -____ - i liked the past version better but there are better things i really liked id oike to see the likes in order and also when your friends send you picture its really slow to appear	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

It's a pretty damn good app however sometimes it randomly closes on its own :/	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
The app itself is ok, opens and closes fine and doesn't clog up the phone but every update makes it worse. It keeps switching to News Feed when I've specified Most Recent. Lags like hell and keeps saying I have notifications when I don't. All in all the app gets worse every day. Better stickin to Internet explorer	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Facebook & Cand crush are going to cost me my job. Mr. Zuckermann are you hiring for anything? Thanks in advance.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
When the app works? It's great. It needs to stop force closing.The random closing is annoying to say the least!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
FFS Facebook. I'm going to DOWNGRADE until you fix Newsfeed (YET AGAIN). FB Failing again.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The latest update did nothing to help, only to cause more frequent crashes.This app is a waste of your time, if you try, try, try again to upload a photo or change your status is creates crashes.This app is basically useless. For people wondering might as well get Twitter instead of wasting your time on Facebook.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It crashes almost daily and has glitches where it just shows the same stuff over and over I have to delete the app all the time and reload it just to get it to work	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slower than a snail and now INFESTED with unwanted ads. Possibly the most disappointing app I use.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I'm deleting the app and just using Safari for Facebook. This is just absolutely ridiculous. I'm getting so frustrated. This is probably the worst app I have used in a while. Get the crashing part fixed!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's good	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
The app doesn't load. It will be on my home screen and it stays blank white. Even though I am connected to wifi nothing loads up on profiles, home, friends or even messages	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
The update is faster, but I still can't share as easily or do other operations compared to the web site.  If I see someone that another has posted, there is no way for me to share it. And, i'm seeing a lot of "Person X likes -- photo," but not real postings. I think I am getting almost entirely advertising. I don't like that.I appreciate being able to do a direct share on the update.I think I've submitted this, but it keeps popping up when I try to write a review, which I'm frequently asked to do.New information-- the FB app crashes more often than any other I have.  Also, when using the app I want to be able to delete or hide certain postings and it seems that I can't do that.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Quit making changes and adding "fixes" that just make it slow, unresponsive, and repeatedly crash. Maybe you can restore the previous update. It was working great then...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I think the Facebook app for iPhone needs improvement as it still crashes.  Also how come we get blocked from adding friends when u send a request but yet they don't tell u who reported they don't know u!?! I think we should have the right to know since I may have a lot of Facebook friends but I don't request them often so I think it would be helpful to know who said they don't know who u are.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

HmmScreen doesn't turn still Made reading easierWas a richer experienceDon't know if its because iPhone users are supposed too get a FB endorsed phone. The groups you set up like "local area" icon is nowhere to be found. So feeds of grouped users don't show up. Random reloading to the top when reopening app after using another. And scrolling back is mind numbing"It needs a previous screen button"Enlarging a pick to see the detail is way to delicate. Is somebody really going fix it?Age verification would be better than banning a site or user!Also offering a rating for filtering would be nice G,Pg, Pg13, R, XXX, Graphic Horror.

I always hesitate to download updates, but there was something I wanted in this one. I can no longer remember what could have been so compelling. All I've got now is an app that crashes every time I try to open it, so I have to open it 2 or 3 times before I can use it. Then it stops working again at random times. I like that I can scroll through multiple photos without having to leave my home page, but it still doesn't allow me to read the entirety of a long caption unless I go to my desktop. I have an iPhone 4, which I recently upgraded to the iOS 5.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

SÌ¼per !!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Since the update its so slow loading and when you click on a photo it either freezes or takes forever loading, it's the worst and slowest update ever! You add things that we don't particularly want where it should be up the individual to set their home pages and sharing options of their choice not yours!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Practically unusable. Won't load/refresh, still crashing, still sticking. Suggested posts appearing in my newsfeed that are obviously paid adverts. Rarely anything interesting. But somehow fb thinks it knows better than me what I want to see, so hides posts from friends, screws up the order things get posted in, and refreshing the feed leads to posts I just read disappearing altogether! Seriously, wtf?	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

A lot of changes need to happen such as picture cropping, app crashing, I don't want to knowing about everybody else comments on Pictures Add featured turn off future comments(you can say) then this bother me what are you meaning by limiting my friend request if the person doesn't like me then they don't have to accepted my friend request, some of the games are ridiculous some ideas need more time to develop,the picture doubling problem, if it an official page of public figure let it be for real(I hate the run around). it's like you need to make another Facebook you bought Instagram and you don't know how long that will last . The privacy act mess up the image possibly persuade by your old university twins but you will never know (great story on your rise to glory) seriously finish your degree in business if your going to be a CEO you got all that money dude in the world I  would finish my business degree if I were in your shoes.

Really slow, force closes frequently, pages will not load, mostly doesn't allow you to tag someone in comments (try to partially type a friends name, their name should pop up and it usually doesn't), basically disappointing to use and overall frustrating.

Serious issues with Facebook for iPhone and Messenger for iPhone. Posted comments often don't post properly over Wifi or 3G. Need to close the app from Task bar and reopen in order to get posting functionality back again. Very poor design an quality control.

At one point this was a great app but the latest update kills off at least one function I valued: Lists. Why does FB have so little respect for friend lists? It was an appreciated feature to be able to select a list and just see those friends in the feed. PLEASE put that back!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Over 50MB for a Facebook app? Caches 20MB of data each time you update your news feed? Each update to this app makes it worse and worse. Hopefully someday soon they realize that! You don't realize how much space this app takes up until you go into your settings and after a week of usage it's taking up 1GB of your phone storage...yikes!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

The app is really good and the update for the icons is good. The way you've added the feelings and stuff to statuses is also good.However the app closes down and crashes in the middle of conversations. If you could fix it would really help. If you could copy people's statuses by highlighting it and using it as your would be good.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

I like Facebook but you should not allow advertisements to be put on the site.  You should have people helping with problems and a phone number.  I am having trouble putting add friends under my picture.  You are not helping me do it.  Every time you up date Facebook I have more problems.  I can not remove page feed.Facebook goes down it crashes.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I have an iPhone 4, and this version crashes every other time I use it, and as usual after the 'update' it is running and loading much slower than before. Why not call it a 'slowdate' instead? Seems more appropriate than update, nothing went up. Asides from it running slow and crashing, yeah it's great.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Great!!!!!!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Annoying posting feature - arbitrarily decides to assign audience based on last group search, instead of using default audience.  No way to adjust this after post has been made.Difficulty bulk loading pics from iPad app.Overall, simply easier to use Windows version for everything but viewing.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I use Facebook mostly on my iPhone. I do not like how it defaults to "News Feed" every time I go back on to the App. I want it to open on "Most Recent"!!!!!  News Feed shows me only what Facebook thinks is more important to me. Most Recent shows me what my friends are doing and what's important to me. Give me the choice of making the decision what I want.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I had lost track of most of my family and friends until I discovered Facebook. Thanks for giving me a way to reconnect with all this people I love as I get up in years.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like Facebook wish their could be more to do on it it be a lot better	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
FB app has been a pretty good ap. I like the chat feature, the bubbles that you can have up or make go away when you're talking to people. I don't like that it filters what you see: ie I dislike having to click on news feed, and most recent, and all friends. I like that it filters out game posts but there are still a lot of ads. And looking at all 3 sections, I still don't feel like I am seeing news from all my friends. I think they could improve by allowing all posts from all friends to come thru (not just the ones it "thinks" you want to see), having a separate tab for things you've "like'd"1	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's straightish	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

The last 3 upgrades(?) have caused me to delete and reinstall this piece of junk just to get it to open again. Multiple 'hangs'. Locks up when updating "reading" status.  Junk!  iPhone 5. Have pretty much given up on this app on my phone. I want to enjoy reading about my friends, not get frustrated!  If I released buggy code like this crap, this many times in a row, I'd get fired.

All I want to do is see my newsfeed in chronological order but this app is too horrible. Sometimes it will let me see it in chronological order and sometimes it gives me feed from 2 days ago.

Just switched from Blackberry and this app is a big improvement over the BB app. I am not having any of the problems others are reporting - no crashes, photos load very quickly.

I shouldn't have to keep choosing 'most recent' after EVERY SINGLE TIME I post something!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The FB app is mostly annoying. It crashes frequently, only shows random posts, and when you post something, it automatically goes back to the top of the newsfeed, whether you had selected most recent or not.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Easy to navigate and has all the basic functions. Fairly easy to use but some features are left out. I do not like the fact that I cannot turn my iPhone sideways and type.

Can we all just agree that this app needs SERIOUS help? If you are going to have a messenger app, take the messenger part out. Make it easier to delete a status. It's really not that hard to make a logical facebook app. Stop trying to make it look cool.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Yep, it's cool	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Im a new iphone inductee app is nice but notifications are not accurate....no big deal. Would be great if i can change the frienship listing of someone but over all so far so good!Update: Much better as i can now change the friendship list on line. Now the challenge is inderstanding the restrictions on each list they seem to have changed and can't find the location to change it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This version that is currently out keeps crashing on me.  It crashes at least 5 times a day.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My previous version of FB for iPhone worked better.  This one doesn't load most things on my news feed.  I tried resetting my wifi but that didn't help.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app is amazing 1 you get to meet new people2 find friends 3 and its awesome	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I wish I could organize the photos, delete albums, combine albums - and generally use this as the online journal that it could be.Otherwise, the messaging function is nice.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
So far, so good. Only experienced a few crashes, but nothing out of the normal. The new status updates are really cute :)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Crashes way too much on my perfectly fine 4s. Sick of tapping a picture and it freezes EVERYTIME!!! I crash and have to reload my phone for the app to work again or go to facebook from the internet on my phone instead FIX IT or i stay at 1 star	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

You fail miserably as developers. You blatantly ignore users' pleas to retire landscape mode, you add 'features' that only slow the app down after you made it run faster in the first place, what is wrong with you?	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crash very frequently, seems like a cheap copy of Path.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Do you release updates before trying them first or do you have 6 year old programming for you? Most recent to me means in order starting newest first but I now get about 6 in order then 12 hours missed out. What is going on? Do not update this app people!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Just sort it out! It crashed and now whenever I open the app it shuts down instantly. I can't even load my messages it just says 'cannot connect'	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
iPod Touch 5th Gen.App crashes occasionaly also when I click on a picture it takes some time before it pops up	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app crashes twice every time I load it, it crashes when I try to look through photo albums, it crashes when I send photos to people, it crashes when I take photos to send to people, it crashes when I write 'too fast' because it can't keep up. It also would be better if I didn't have to load the photo on my news feed. I am using a 4th generation iPod and I think it is unfair for this app to only fully work on a 5th generation.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Another update, still no fix for the 'Most Recent' news feed option.The lack of an option to set 'Most Recent' as the default news feed option is incredibly frustrating. Why the app designers have set it to show me the same week old stories when it starts up and then go through a series of lags and hangs in order to view the most recent stories is beyond me. The app is no longer user friendly and it's quicker to log on through the web browser thus defeating the purpose of having a stand alone app.I hope the developers restore the option to choose a default view as this (along with some other tweaks like reducing the text size of comment links etc) has made the app a slow and unenjoyable experience.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Much better! Thanks guys! You read my review! Also, could you add the hashtags please! Thanks!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Love the app	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
As best I could tell, the last updated version didn't allow you to turn off the chat feature. As a person who's not a big fan of online chatting, I had found this pretty frustrating and was on the verge of deleting the app. So I was happy to download today's updated version and discover that it once again allows you to turn off chat -- just go to the top right of the chat window, click on the top, and a "turn off chat" option will appear. Glad for the update.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Better! Several bugs have been fixed with this release (6.2) including the bug that caused the UI to be inconsistent on my iPhone 4S. Still a bit finicky at times and not as powerful as the web interface, but it's a lot better than it was.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I can't seem to stop it sending all my personal information to the US government! Oh... and I keeps crashing!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I have to open and re open and then re re open just to actually use the app, then, if you are trying to view a picture or read a post in further detail, nope the Crashbook app crashes, the bubble message thing is stupid, and I just use the safari browser now to check Facebook.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update made it where I can't post any statuses. It fails every time. I just want to post on Facebook without any hassle.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Update didn't fix the crashes. Still crashes two times when starting.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Used to be good. Now timeline out of order. Comments out of time order so it looks like someone answered before you asked. Cannot see albums of photos on liked pages which for some pages is the whole point. If a pages has thousands of photos you don't want to be looking through a mixture. Completely rubbish and for me a waste of time. Back to the pc as mobile just not good enough so much for mobile technology. You would think with all the money Facebook have that they would fully test stuff before launching it to market.New update hasn't fixed the photo issue just made it worse. So now you can't see the albums you don't even if access to the photos. I'm an artist and use pages to show my work so off. so off to some place else  no point in facebook if people can't see my work.New update 18th June. Said it fixed bugs but hasn't all the same. Completely pointless.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Keeps crashing even though the update game out	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Crashes every time I open it, at least once. I can never browse my photos because it either loads slower than a sloth or crashes when it gets overwhelmed. How many complaints till it is fixed? Stop adding features and make it accessible. I thought the update would fix this, but clearly choosing who can view your shared stuff is of upmost importance. Slow clap Facebook.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Absolute Garbage.. Ever heard the expression.. IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT! New notification bar at the bottom is horrendous.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I thought that this update will have the hashtag option :/ more than a update with new things we need a performance update	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Can we please get a Facebook app icon change. It just looks to plan. The same old icon just gets old.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Birthdays should be shown on the newsfeed at the top like the web version.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great update to the bugs found in version 6.1. The app is now fully functional and more importantly, usable. "Animation" sequences (opening chat heads, photos, etc) no longer takes eons.In all, an awesome fix. Version 6.2 is no longer a RAM hog. Still hoping to be able to delete comments/posts within the app one day! :P	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
That update made everything Worse it won't load pictures profile pictures and just in general won't load	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still unable to read 'posts by others' on pages on any device.  This has been so for months now - why are we prevented from reading what others have written and are forced to just be able to read the highlights page?  Also not seeing everything on my timeline, just compared iPhone to PC screen and loads of posts are missing from iPhone - I use my phone when travelling and need to see ALL posts.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

This used to be a really good app before Facebook decided it was desirable to churn out endless, repetitive and irrelevant advertisements up to every third post. They're unblockable (hiding just means they come back out later), unreportable (spam reporting is ignored since FB gets paid to insert them into your timeline) and make the app completely unusable. I'm only giving it even one star because I can't select a negative number. Avoid at all costs.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Uploading photos to Facebook thru any browser is just a no go, so I decided to check out this app... so many new and bad reviews for this version, but I was like, "well, I can always delete it."It works great for me on this (gen 1) iPad.  I've had other versions of this app before and wound up deleting them, but for now this one is a keeper! I wonder how many poor reviews are from people with either an iPhone (or perhaps even a newer generation of iPad?  I'd give it a try and see if it works for you... takes more time to write a bad review than it does to delete a crappy app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Stick to ONE format and add features to it. Once we get used to a "new" format, you guys change it up AGAIN.STOP!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The New Updates Is Wonderful	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It pretty much always works as I want it to, except when I'm relying on my 3G cellular network. But at home it almost always does what I want it to. I do wish I could copy and paste again! But I love being able to tag people from my mobile device.I do not like seeing 48 notifications on my home screen, but when I open the app there is only 3. It is irritating! I have slight OCD and I don't like the red numbers always up on my home screen. Love the "feeling‰Û_" addition to this update!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Ok I have two iOS systems my phone and my iPod touch Gen2, opening this up on my phone is fine but I'm constantly having issues opening Facebook on my iPod. You seriously need to fix that for ALL iOS systems not just the current ones	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

All these updates you have for this app yet you still haven't made it landscape applicable.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I kinda like it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Overall great FB app- only downside, it freezes up @ least 1-2Xs Daily :/Some times it kicks me off entirely	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashes almost every two minuets	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Keeps closing ALL THE TIME. When I'm typing or messaging someone it keeps closing and losing all that I typed. It's becoming very frustrating.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I love Facebook I have friends and family that I haven't seen in years that I keep in touch with :)	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Ups and downs but now I really like all the changes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's hard to find a app that actually gets better with every update! But this app does work better and shows improvement every time!! Facebook has been listening to its users and I love it!! Keep doing what your doing people!! And for the people complaining, get over it they can't meet everyone's needs at the same time! Stop being spoiled!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Stop updating 3 and 4 times a month. Get it right and stop it for real. How ever this is a delightful waste of time and waaaay better that most other social networks.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Won't even let me ask friend request to people I don't know...Oh like thats not going on...get real!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Always something with Facebook but its a good app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love this app but hate that it takes me 3 attempts at opening it to use it. So many crashes now! I like the new additions but fix the bugs already!!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Not reliable enough to be called facebook	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
now it doesnt even show up on my screen and i cant get into the app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Big thumbs down. This app is completely pointless. I only see posts from the same five people every day -- about 1% of the posts I see when I log in via web browser. Complete waste of time.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why cant i hide post from friends without unfriend them? I cant delete post and its very diff the app from the computer.... Hate all those comercial spots!!...FB u r losing me!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
As a small business worker, it's tough to get advertisement out there. We started a Facebook page and have 120+ likes, but only a few people are seeing our post regularly because we don't pay the fee. I really don't like that.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
What was a reasonable app (with some issues) has turned into a very unreasonable app with lots of issues!! Now slower, confusing hard to find buttons. Let's go back to previous version.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Good updates, fluid operation.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Not to impressed with the last update.  I have activity sent to Most recent but when I share a picture or post it takes my activity to news feed. Or when I share a picture or quote, I have to scroll all the way back down to where I was instead of continuing after sharing.  Plz fix!! Very annoying  on Iphone5	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Don't update to the latest version it doesn work yet again Facebook why do you bother trying to fix something that isn't broken try learning by your mistakes for once	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Luv it!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
STILL no sound or vibration when notifications pop up after TEN months. Also, the app still crashes. Mostly when trying to open a photo on a Page. This is on mine and my wifes iPhone 5's, and was on my iPhone 4 as well. The new version has removed the alphabetic letters from the side of the friends list which makes it harder to get to the friend you want, and the news feed always reverts to Top Stories instead of leaving it on Most Recent or whatever people wants it on.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Great app but you need to take that bubble off in your next update its dreadful?!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Pretty good but crashes WAY too much!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It is worse after update! Seriously!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Much easier and love that I now get my private messages instantly instead of 8 days later!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Poorly designed, quite buggy. How about you guys stop experimenting?!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I find it irritating that you cannot edit or delete a status from the app. Group functionality is also lacking. App is ok if you just want to scroll though other people's statuses.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Dont update. Terrible.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The new Update of Facebook is great. There's no trouble. I like it. I have a Facebook.!! It's sometime work. But it's okay check out ARCADE CLAW APP..!!! Please	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I've done everything from killing the app, restarting my iPod, and redownloading the app and ALL IT EVER DOES IS CRASH. FIX IT!!!! Whether I'm trying to upload pictures or view a friends timeline or even my own, all it does is crash. And I hate the stupid bubble thing that pops up for messages. It's annoying and gets in the way and makes the app crash even more than it already does.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App closes it self	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Facebook is much better then it use to be.  But, today, I was looking for an add for an ad that I saw on my timeline a week ago.  I couldn't find the add even after scrolling down as far as I could.  There was no way to search for that posting. If that could be changed, it would make FB better.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Mine sometimes crashes on iPhone five and just closes the app down then I have to click it again and I loose the page I'm on. And when I look at pictures, the edges are missing and I have to zoom out to see the whole picture. Other then that I do like it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

Developers need to make it possible for Facebook apps for mobile and tablet devices to to all things one can do on a PC, since far more people are using mobile and tablet devices... Slow to update, updates missing for friends, app crashes, the list goes on and on!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just wished it would put all the current post on top. It's to scattered. Just don't keep changing all the time	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This application is not comparable to the mobile version. The mobile version has more capabilities and options then this app. For example, the app freezes and you cannot view your archived messages. Also you cannot unfollow someone's post after receiving several notifications.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Please read the daily comments written under the sections when we use new functions ! Some of them doesn't work yet complicated best function will be cut and paste for the status section so we can use on the translate on phone App if its in other language! Same as we do it on the computer ! Current version is the worst !!! It's keep crashing and cut and paste option doesn't work so the share option for others post is mostly broken too !!! Still nothing is fixed !! All my comments are deleting it self and had to be written again !! It's the comments we put under others post that is!!! New version is not improved either!I never though I would but if not fixed I will cancel my account !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

The latest update to the app seems to have crashed the ability of the news feed to update.  It works fine over the web, but I can't use the app any longer.  Avoid.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever since the last update my Facebook app for iphone 5 doesn't work at all anymore. Constantly says updating but never does!  I've deleted and reinstalled numerous times only for the same result!  Please fix this issue!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I cant stand the fact that I always have to hit the ‰ÛÏall friends‰Û button just to see the recent status. Please fix it. I would love this app so much more if they would just fix that. Thank you.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Still haven't fixed the bug where the app closes spontaneously all the time (usually just as I'm about to press send in chat).	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Can't use app at all after updating. Get a "Session expired" error. Have deleted and re-installed 3 times. Still get the error. Ridiculous that the largest social networking platform puts out such a poor quality app. Testers, anyone???	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Used to work fine.  Updated and then seems to love to just hang.  Pages take 20-30 seconds to load.  Every once and a while the app will crash just to keep it interesting.  It is simpler for me to just get on FB using Safari.  Pain, but it actually works	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I use it on my iPhone everyday and enjoy being able to stay in contact with family and friends. The only thing I would add is to be able to copy and paste on some posts.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook has been running very slow and freezing up it keeps kicking me off and sometimes it takes a few times of going to the app for it to open please fix this!!! :-(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Seems like it fails more, with every update. Viewing news feed by newest first is so broken, and puts a few in order but the rest is mixed up. I'm seeing stuff from previous day, after posts from 1~2 hours ago. I don't understand how a web version that runs through a browser can still be more superior to a actual app designed for the soul purpose of doing all things Facebook.As always, Ads are annoying the s*** out of me too.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
QUIT  PRETENDING TO FIX THIS JUNK, all you ever do is make it worse, time for an uninstall and go back to the archaic way of going on the Internet	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This review is only for the developers really....when you swipe to the left you have the names of all your friends Facebook tells you if they are online or not but when it has the mobile icon with 1m next to it and you open a chat to "John Appleseed" it says they are online at the top (in one place it says they have just come offline and on the other try are still active) hope this review helps. Great app, use it all the time. Also if like to add when I post a status a ghost status appears before the actual one I can only see the ghost one though.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Anytime you read an article that someone posts, it crashes. If you try and look at any posts from earlier in the day, it crashes. It also skips 8-9 hours of posts from the "Most Recent" part of the news feed. I am constantly frustrated using this app. It has only gotten worse with too many bells and whistles that slow it down.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I'd have to say this is one of the most frustrating apps I have ever used! It's definitely crashbook!!!! It crashes frequently and the app is true slow. It's not my phone either.

Wow. I can't believe that FB just automatically wrote a review on here when I first logged into write one myself.

If you are using the 4 inch retina on the iPhone 5 than you will come across this issue. When ever you view a photo that is in a different aspect ratio, it is automatically zoomed in. When you try to zoom out so you can see the entire image, it is obscured by the bar at the top and the text below. You tap once for it to go away, and it does but the photo resizes and you can't see all of the photo once again. There is no way around it, and its frustrating.On the larger retina, images should not be expanded to fit the top and the bottom. It should be sized to fit the sides. Taping once should only hide the interface and text, not resize the image as well. It's incredibly annoying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I love it! It's simple & quick to stay in touch & I love the ease to upload my precious pix	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Have no problems with this app. Works great.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Generally speaking this is a good app. But it could be a lot better. The biggest problem I have is sometimes the app freezes for about 30 seconds or just completely crashes out if I try and look at pictures. There are a few other little inconveniences such as no being able to change your cover photo (as far as I am aware) and as you can't do it on safari/chrome on iPad you have to use a computer to change it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Although the application is ok, the newer versions have been ever so slow to load or view anything on it. The original version was the best as it was faster to navigate!! Way too many crashes!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

iPhone 5They've improved it a bit but you still can't edit captions or anything you post once you post it. Also, sometimes you can't scroll a zoomed-in picture. Furthermore, it still crashes here and there and the notifications are almost always wrong! It tells me I have "x" amount but when I log in, it's a different amount.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The issues with this app are too numerous to list all but here is a brief overview: crashes frequently while loading, freezes more than it scrolls, can take 5-10 minutes to load no matter what reception or Internet access is, 9 times out of 10 the most recent updates will be 8 hours or more old, status updates do not post, privacy settings change on their own....that is just a start. I rarely use it anymore since it is essentially not functional.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It does crash a lot, and I also don't like that I have to keep changing the news feed to Most Recent as it defaults to people that just post a lot, many of which I don't care about.  I also wish I had a way to easy search for my friends by a particular city of state when I am visiting there.

This app is so slow that's faster and easier to just use the Safari browser. It crashes 15 times a day too.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is my third time deleting and reinstalling this app because it just doesn't open. When it does open, it only opens to something on my newsfeed from weeks ago and "loads" forever. And no- it isn't my Internet, it's this dumb app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I like reading my friends posts. I don't like: choosing most recent (and having to re-choose most recent daily) and getting posts from two days ago before 30 minutes ago (?!?), being asked daily if I want updates sent to my phone (I turned that feature off for a reason), and constantly have my feed inundated with 'recommended pages'. If all that cow excrement were to be fixed, I'd rate the app 4-5 stars, maybe. However, whoever is in charge has proven that as they 'fix' one problem, they create four or five more irritating problems. ;(	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It will not refresh the newsfeed on my iPhone 4s.  It keeps loading but doesn't change.  You have to completely close out of the app and log back in to get it to show anything recent.  I'm going back to MySpace!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great easy to use app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Stopped showing recent posts.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's good, wish it would load faster without Internet	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

I like the fb app for iPad but I don't have nearly as much options as the mobile app for my phone... They can do so much more with there post and comments... I NEED MORE OPTIONS!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Awesome	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
need to update does not load anything at all !!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I haven't been able to get on my Facebook app for several days because it just doesn't upload at all. The most recent post showing up on my newsfeed is from 2 days ago. Even my own profile page won't load. I have tried uninstalling and re-installing but that doesn't work either. There is just way too much going on on the Facebook app. I just want status updates and pictures. Everything else is fluff that is not needed. I much prefer Instagram now and I am contemplating getting rid of Facebook altogether. It has become so complicated and busy, it's lost the whole reason Facebook was created in the first place: to connect with people via pictures and statuses. The new message bubble is the worst thing Facebook has done yet. It's pointless, hard to use, and just plain frustrating. Go back to the basics, Facebook.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app to keep up with family and friends	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Overall it is a great little app but to do certain things still I need to go directly to the website......a little frustrating?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Ever since the last 5 or so updates, this app keeps crashing. Try to use it but after 30 seconds, it crashes. FIX THE DAMN APP, IT'S COMPLETELY USELESS.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
No. Facebook is constantly crashing on me. It's annoying as hell when you're going down your newsfeed or having a serious conversation with your friend, and it crashes, forcing you to scroll ALL the way down your newsfeed or having to retype an entire paragraph.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Overall quite satisfied, can be lagging at times and does randomly close occasionally, but 95% of the time it runs smoothly and effectively, I like the constant additions to the IOS integration	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Haven't had any problems with this app.So far so good:)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Good app all the basics are compressed for iPhone I haven't had a problem so far	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Awesome! No issues	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Each change that is added to this app, it's beneficial.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Too many advertisements. And the photo viewer is totally defective, it doesn't work.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The social media has changed into commercials and apps that I don't want or even see on my FB. It has become horrible.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It won't update my notifications (I know I have them because if I go on my desktop it tells me I do) and crashes like nobody's buisness.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
love it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This version of the app will not update, I have to keep opening and closing it to try to get it to update.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works well for social and business networking. Thx	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
The latest update of this app has problems because it enters and turns out they have to repair	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Freezes every time I try to view a picture or read comments on pictures. Pretty frustrating.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It is the best	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I have never been so frustrated or disappointed by an app. Every upgrade fixes the crashing for roughly a week and then we're right back. Continual crashes, extreme lag, etc.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is awful. I'm still waiting from yesterday to reload my news feed. Come on Facebook. All that money and you can't get your app right.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love this new upgrade its cute and hip with the times. Wouldn't change it back.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still needs some functions, such as moving pictures from one album to another	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
You really need to fix this app from crashing before your users start disliking the Facebook experience on the iPhone..	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Usually facebook app works amazing! But recently  on ipod,ipad,and iphone the messenger part of it doesnt work! It has a glitch that won't show updated and fully downloaded messages,so it makes communication more difficult. I have asked others I am fb messengering with and they have experienced the same problem.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's ok. Just feel it could be better. More eye catching.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I hate this new version. Crashes all the time. Locks up. Missing post. Aggravating	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's okay. As others have said it crashes without notice.  Very shaky when searching for for a page. Letters stick and take time to type in SEARCH box.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I enjoy Facebook to connect with old and new friends. But I do not like the bashing that goes on from time to time.  I wish we can keep more private as well. TMI sometimes!  But why does Facebook keep shutting down of late and to get back on you must sign in all over?  What happened to "remembering my sign in?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Constantly crashing, not just mine but everyone else's too!!! SORT IT OUT!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Latest update still crashes a bit...especially when trying to view my NewsFeed in chronological order, especially since I have to reset that display EVERY SINGLE TIME. I've disabled the annoying bubbles, so that is not as much of an issue.First, you took away the landscape orientation (hate the portrait) and, now, it's very challenging to see my newsfeed in order. I don't care what OTHER people think is important. It's usually hours btwn logins..I want to see threads develop. Please fix. Thanks.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I love all the new updates and all but Facebook constantly crashes!!!! And it's not just mine.. My best friends does the same thing!!! Very annoying. Other than that love it!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app crashes at least once every time open it. The pics load so slowly I sometimes decide to just wait until I'm on my computer to look at them. The newsfeed and most recent news never load all the way so there is a zigzag line between a post 2 hours ago and a post made last night at 11pm. Please update and fix everything because it's getting so frustrating for all of us!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So many updates, only to continuously fail. -_-	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This version is definitely better, but still not fully functional like my laptop!If it weren't for my iPad's ease of use and portability, I wouldn't chose to open Facebook using it!You can do better!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I hate that the Apple/iTunes App Store almost forces updates. That being said, the current FB app update would not load after 4 days. Subsequently, after reading the reviews pertaining to the update, I simply choose to delete the app altogether. Why waste time forcing an unnecessary, bug infested version, especially after fair warning. No thanks! Let me know when the issues have been resolved.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This sh*t always kicks me out of the app, and it's terrible,  I'm sorry but you need to fix this asap! I'm tired of deleting it and re-installing it...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The Facebook app is amazing I giv it five stars.he truly thought of everything that could possibly be on a social network.thank you mark .	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Overall the job gets done but the app doesn't allow full functions of FB and tends to not show a lot of status updates. And u can't tag from IOS.. Freezes a lot and can't do enough settings on app	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
FIX THE CONSTANT CRASHING! That's all it does is crash. I have to open it 45 times before it works. I go to look at pictures or continue reading a post it crashes.

It used to be that I had to tell the app I wanted to view my news feed in "most recent" ordering every time I opened the app. Now the feature appears to be completely broken. Who knows how many items I ACTUALLY care about I am missing. Also, it seems I can no longer categorically ban updates from specific games and apps my friends are using from showing up in my feed. I don't care that someone farted in Candy Squish Bonanza.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't open my chats again. I will click the chat button and the list will come up but when I click a name it won't show up. The old chat was fine and worked perfectly, it didn't need to be changed.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I've skipped the "update your information" sections probably 15 times thus far but it keeps showing up. Why in God's name would anyone be stupid enough to actually list their address, phone number , or any other private information like that if it weren't a business? Please stop asking.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app is great!! I love Facebook that's basically all I do is go on Facebook and I hate going on Facebook on the computer. It's just such a piss off to be honest. It's so much easier on the phone and it's faster. Great job!!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

I love my Facebook and keeping it touch with everyone, as well as the powerful marketing tool it is! But why is this app so huge? And why, after a gazillion updates, does it still constantly crash? And last but not least, why must there be a separate app if you want to use your business pages from your mobile device? So then we have to have two crashing, space hog apps on our device!? Ugh!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app continues to lack the functionality if the browser version of Facebook.  I also am getting very tired of the intrusive ads the are evermore prevalent in the feeds.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Ok i understand that crashing and freazing happens due to the large amount of data used, but when it crashes loading a picture we are going to have a problem. And i dont like how they disabled changing the keyboard from portrait to landscape.Honestly this is barely better than trying to run it in apple's craptacular mobile browserRevision on last review: i think the product has in fact gotten worse! Ok so the crashes have gotten more frequent, its taking up more memory with each update! the connection is very slow and pathetic how is it taking seconds to load a picture even on a high end connection! If it were not for the fact i like to keep in touch with friends i would delete this app!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Every other update seems stable. This one is working fine, with minimal crashes. Last version was a nightmare.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
After update it freezes and crashes constantly. Sometimes it crashes before it even opens. "Most recent" is often not in reverse chronological order and I still can't view in landscape. So frustrating I usually skip it and just use Twitter.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Between trying to load a friends' page to trying to open a shared link, this App will anger you more than anything else. You're better off using Safari!And don't let updates fool you; they make everything worse. When I started, the app had a lot of loading problems, but nothing awful. Now, the only thing that will load is my news feed, which shows multiples of the same update and likes to refresh itself when I'm mid sentence.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest version for iPhone has been a terrible one.  It endlessly asks if I want to synch FB to my iPhone and for whatever reasoning, selecting not to synch means endless harassment until I give in and comply from the looks of it. Furthering my frustration is when I attempt to check recent activity on a "status update" FB now has an option to synch by "clicking here to learn more" (or similar wording).	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The Facebook app has everything it needs to be a good app, a nice interface, (with a few minor exceptions) good IMing, and obviously, the app does get the job done. ...if it starts. In order to get the stupid app to start, I have to go through starting the app a couple of times to immediately crash. Then it works, albeit slowly. Also, whenever I open up a photo in full view, sometimes I can go into the next photo, but sometimes, I can't. Overall, 2/5 for annoying bugs. If they were all fixed, I'd give this a 4/5.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I used to lovethis app even better than actually going on my laptop because i only like most recent not top stories and te app would remember my preferences so that i didnt have tochoose it each and every time i wanted to scroll thru my wall. Now each time i go onto it i have to choose most recent and so much of the time it says none available when its been 8 hrs or the most recent are fromthen and no amount of reloading helps fix it. And when you FINALLY et it to work right then after you scroll about ten pages down to start looking at what youve missed, eqch time you click on anything i mean anything even just a pic to blow it up it starts all over with nothing! And you have to start over trying to manipulate itto show you most recent instead of top news and scroll down again to the point where you left off! The messenger on the program and the separate messenger both get in the way too and if you have bothyou cant even use the regular app to answer messeges without the same thin happening! Every time it says i needto update this thing i dont want to because the only thing that gets changed is the stuff that does work doesnt anymore and the thingsthat didnt work are more aggravating!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Unlike some people, I haven't had a huge issue with crashes until this latest release. Seems to crash quite often. I've restarted my phone a few times and also restarted the app itself but it still seems to crash. Please fix this.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

When I click on a picture, the app will get stuck, not let me move it at all, then I have to restart the app. On top of that it crashes very frequently.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

No problems yet	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Slow to load even with wi-fi and crashes a lot. Thought the update would improve it, but no such luck. "Most recent" includes posts from two minutes ago as well as 24-hours ago - posts are all out of order. Fix the actual functionality of the app before adding more features or "improvements". Nothing more frustrating than an app that doesn't work - it's faster to just use Chrome and login to FB. IPhone 4s	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I like staying in touch with old friends and relatives. I hate the adds, friend suggestions, and like suggestions. I use privacy settings but there still is not enough privacy. I want to be able to mark that only close friends can see my phone and email but I do not get that option. There are times the suggestions annoy me so much I start getting tempted to delete my account.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app is nice for going on my profile or that of friends, or chatting with a single friend. However, it very often hates to load and constantly crashes. Also, there is no way to put your newsfeed in chronological order, so reading some friends posts gets really jumbled because you will read one from a few hours ago long before you ever see the newer ones that supplement the older post. Sometimes, i find it easier to just go to safari to look at the posts on facebook. At least i can sort things there. The chat stuff is just annoying. I mean, how do you get rid of the group chats on the side? You can easily exit out of a single one, but not a group chat. And the bobbles just get annoying. You try to click on them and instead they move and vise versa. An okay app, but needs a lot of work.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
4 years of Facebook and they still can't get the app right. Freezes, takes ages to load then just closes. It puts me off facebook using the app. Facebook is fine, the app needs sorting out!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
App works well enough I guess. Still crashes sometimes. If privacy & security issues w/facebook don't scare you, the iPhone app shouldn't.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Facebook is a billion dollar company. Almost everyone with a phone uses this app. It freezes & crashed almost every time I use it. They definitely could've done better.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is awesome for talking to mates, partners & post videos onto your posts so that everyone else can look at the videos	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

Oh how I wish the iPad app was as good as the iPhone version! On the little phone screen Facebook is beautiful! I see full photos and longer posts, cover photos, it's fast and never crashes... iPad version, total opposite! Why do I have a bigger screen yet see less content?? Photos are trimmed top & bottom, posts are shortened, no cover photos, teeny tiny profile pics, videos display even worse than photos.. The iPad is for graphically engaging the user, yet the Facebook app feels like I'm wearing blinders! It's better to open Facebook in Safari and use the full web version than to use an app that Facebook has total control over yet fumbles to create anything interesting.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

With the newest/current upgrade this app has some great new features, my favorite one is the continuous crashes! Can't attach or share or open!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app seems to be convenient and in some ways is, but those chat heads are simply annoying. I like to look at my messages full-screen, and there should be some way to hide the bubbles for good. Currently, you can hide them, but the next time the person messages you, it reappears. I want to be able to get completely rid of them! Furthermore, just about every five minutes, the app crashes! I lose everything I had typed in Messages and it's extremely irritating.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It always crashes and I have to re-open it and it just crashes again?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Within two minutes the app crashed 3 times. You can't look at photos on the app or it will crash. It usually takes 2-3 tries before the app will even opens up. Super slow and crashes too much to use.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the last upgrade the app keeps freezing and I have to delete and re-install to make it work again. I also hate the grey bar at the top that tells you someone has commented, that's what the red icons are for!! Loved this app before this.. Change it back please!!!! Update: wrote the above yesterday.. Have had to delete and reinstall twice since then.. This used to be a great app.. SORT IT OUT PLEASE!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This version is the best yet of Facebook however my newsfeed is never 'Most Recent' when I choose this option. Can this be changed? I know my friends update all the time but it shows the same friends over and over again even when they post something the day before when I'm in 'most recent' newsfeed mode. Thanks!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app works ok, but it will close out randomly an you have to attempt to open it several times before it will actually open. Also I wish we could comment in a status when you share a photo or link	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app works pretty good most the time. Rarely glitches on me. But what I dislike is that, since I keep 2 accounts, I have to constantly log out and log in and all that. Twitter has a nice little function to just switch accounts fast and nicely, I believe Facebook should also have this function for those like me who need to manage multiple accounts	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Loads slowly, can't see my friends unless I go into my profile and it takes forever to load up anything on anyone else's profile and photos!!! Plus now it forecloses every time until it finally loads!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This app crashes constantly even if I don't have any back programs running. It will say that I have 6 notifications when I only have 2. And my messages don't always show up. A lot of the times it doesn't post my pictures. And it will say that I posted a status today when it was 2 days ago. Love the layout and love the idea of it. Just a few bugs.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Crashes more, freezes more, too many commercials...compared to 2 years ago this is a marked deterioration when used on an IPAD. On my PC works very well, but still too many advertisements in the time line.It only gets worse as time passes.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook app is good but it has its moments. It keeps cutting off on me when I'm on it and sometimes it will take forever to load things. And it's not my service or anything. But other than that its a good app, I just wish that they would stop changing everything on it.....just fix the bugs and leave everything else alone.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Still getting false notifications! Example: the app will show on screen I have 10 notifications and when I enter the app all I have are 2. This has been a problem for too long no matter what I do.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I love Facebook but Facebook is not for minor special when the minor is ADHA... Please check is a lot a kid it not support	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
My Facebook was recently updated to the one where the new layout means all of your tabs such as "messages" and "notifications" are on the bottom of the page. All I can say is: "Go home, you are drunk." This is in no way easier to use, now when I scroll through my news feed I almost always open my messages, and although it isn't difficult to get back to where I was. It's annoying as heck. The rest of the features aren't bad, it's just the layout that lets it down... But hey, congratulations, Facebook, you are the the first and probably the only app I will ever review.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

I love it. my oy suggestion is you know how you can tag people, put your location ect, well I think that you should also be able to put hashtags!

Overall amazing app well created. It is a little slow from time to time but good app good layout and decent app 5/5	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Has stopped working. Just getting the timer whirring away. On latest iOS.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
There really is no reason for me to have to click the "most recent " button to have the posts in order everytime I open the app,  It should always be "most recent" ..Now when I share a post the newsfeed changes to "newsfeed" instead of most recent No push notifications either anymore.. Keep trying, eventually someone will get a working version together we hope	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Yet again you have given us another pointless update yet still not fixed the basic stuff like text freezing ,delays in viewing pics and notifications ,sporadic page notifications and constantly not being able to scroll back on the Messenger system Sort out the foundations before adding another story to this decrepit building site	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Can't share to twitter, temperamental, keep erasing my likes, and slow	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App keeps crashing even with the new update	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not happy with Facebook, the most recent newsfeed doesn't work and I'm always seeing posts from hours or days ago, the app crashes all the time, it says I have notifications when I don't, you keep changing things but not taking into consideration what people are complaining about.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes at least once every 2 days.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Mustt Download... Fast at Times But The Updates Are Good nd The Bubble For The Messages Yeahh I likes it	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Nice.Takes long to show the amount of likes and comments someones pics have when scrolling through them, never had this problem before the update.Just 'news feed' should already be most recent. I shouldn't have to select it every time i go on facebook!Also, the app STILL crashes and closes itself. How have you possibly not fixed this yet? You make billions more than other companies, their apps work fine, surely yours should too! (Also, it's not crashing because my phone is old, because it isn't, it's an iPhone 5, so it should work)TEST YOUR APPS BEFORE RELEASING THEM!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
It's cute with the little circles for the messages c:	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm not sure what you did in the last update but now the app will not refresh.  I have been trying for 2 days.  Please fix.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
keeps crashing whilst on chat	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Some feeds don't show any comments until you click on 'comments' then magically you find out you've been missing out on a conversation. Also it would be really handy to be able to go straight to a friends comment that they've made on another page, instead of having to scroll right through all 2000 other posts before finding it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Love it except I can't find the edit/delete options once you press enter under post/comments...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

With this update, not even my newsfeed will update. Stop adding crap if it already DOES NOT WORK.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love it! So I can keep in touch with my family and friends!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app is easy to use but enough changes, it's good, leave it alone now :)Being able to play all the games on mobile that one plays on the full site would be nice.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
With every new update comes something new that doesn't work. Now my phone constantly tells me I have at least 30 notifications, when its actually 1 or 0!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
These last 2 updates have significantly decreased the quality of this app. The new message bubble system is flawed. The old message system was just fine. And now the app randomly crashes all the time. And I'm not exaggerating in the least.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Well I was having problems earlier with the new version but everything is fine now however it still crashes but it's not it's fault it my iPod's	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love it most the time, just wish it didn't crash so often	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app. Sometimes closes out but everything has its problems. Great job in letting me post faster! And on the run!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Just updated the FB app. 19/06/13. And it keeps freezing and not refreshing the page. Never had this problem before and it's pretty frustrating when wanting to have a quick look at FB :/	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This new update seems easy to use Abe really functional. I am happy so far.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Liking the new Facebook app!!! So much better than the older version	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Decent app but with all the money you'd think they could make an app that's not so buggy and slow. Also the suggested sites,advertising, and the fake friends really are stupid. You make it to complex to do simple operations people want to do and have no customizability.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love It!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Why cant you post pictures on comments if you're on mobile? But if you're on a computer/laptop you can.please update/fix this as fast as possible.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Ever since I updated the app it no longer works it just keeps loading or crashes and shuts my iphone off. Not happy with this update!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
{This App has had a, shall we say, an uneasy evolution. It has at times worked wonderfully and then along comes an update and it takes 3 steps backwards. I'm pleased with it in its current form, it works for me. I'm not giving it 5* as it does sometimes take a while to load items but I'm happy with everything else (probably until the next 'update' that is). }^^Above was my last review of the Facebook App. How prophetic we're the last 7 words of it ! Along comes an 'update' (I naturally assume this means it will be an improvement) and YET AGAIN we take 10 steps backwards. Here's why :Updating.......................updating..............................................................................updating......................[still] updating.................ANNOYING ISN'T IT ? Here's what to do Facebook - sack/dismiss/get shot of the entire set of useless App programmers that you currently employ and actually hold proper interviews to enable you to employ people that are able to do the job. There are 16 year olds creating world class Apps these days, employ some of them rather than the shower that currently must sit around playing table pong all day and not caring that they are losing you users and money every day. It's not a lot to ask that you produce an App that actually works. Is it ?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Well you kept bugging me in how I felt about this app... I enjoy it. Love it even. But my love is slashed, burned, and defiled every time the app crashes. Which is often. About 30+ times a day.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So you finally get to delete & now you can't #FAIL	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
All It does is crash no matter what I try to do. Won't update either	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Like everyone else I would like to say, the app is crap.. You keep on coming up with updates to "fix bugs", horses crap.. Every single time an update comes out it does nothing but screws it up even more than it was in the first place..	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
fb has gotten better since it gave me an updated fb the other day thank u	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
And the updates just get worse and worse. This app is terrible.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This is a good app its worth getting! But sometimes its crashes	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It freezes sometimes but over all good	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

How many time do you have to press "comments" to actually see them? And why is it so imprecise the area where you can actually press. Visually it looks good but it's crashing all the time. It mixes everything and even posts stuff you upload to closed groups to your public wall!Isn't updating supposed to improve things?It is worse than ever. Dislike!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Haha sorry all in the title	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
My only complaint is the loss of landscape position.Okay, FB just had to harass me for another rating.It lost a star.Crash! Crash! Crash! Lost another starNow crashes even more since updates.Well, the jackasses insisted on a rating AGAIN. Good timing, the app has gone from bad to worse. This rating system needs stars on the negative scale for FB. Every update makes the app worse	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook will crash on me and I'll have to open and reopen . It needs to be updated there's bugs . Very disapointed	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook is a great app where I found a lot of information of my science studies. I found one problem with the app and is when you share something the news feed comeback to the beginning. Fix it that and will be a excellent app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
After using Facebook on iPhone 4 for a long time this is the worst version. I cannot refresh anything at all it sits saying updating but doesn't actually update. No problems on iPad, or laptop, checked on different network and still the same!! Not happy!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I've now installed and reinstalled this app 4-5 times in the last 24-36 hour period. It will work briefly, then fail to update data, leading to the need to delete and reinstall. Please fix this glitch ASAP.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love the app, by far, is the one I use the most. But lately it crashes a lot. Always crashes when I'm using the chat. It's driving me crazy. :/And on iphone, why not landscape?? Please enable it!!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

It'd be extremely awesome for me to look at my updated newsfeed and my Facebook page not skip to all the previous days newsfeed. Facebook fixes one thing then screws up another. You guys are really dropping the ball here	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Every update adds or removes functions, but it seems to continue to get more and more complicated and less and less stable...the most recent update causes my phone to freeze and half the functions don't work and cause Facebook to crash.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Alot of crashes	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Don't know if it's the update, but I am unable to get beyond a white screen when I tap it.  It's been working just fine for months and now suddenly crashes.  Please fix it, please!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I love this app - thanks FB! I also love that u added the emotions like you did to the comp. that's AWESOME! Thanks! I don't understand why people use the ratings to report bugs. That's why there's an option to contact the developers people!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I should've never updated! No photos load up, it takes a while for my wall to update and it's sooooo slow. I thought it was my Wifi or 3G but I'm not having trouble with any other app. FIX IT!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Why would you possibly think that no one wants to type on a landscape keyboard? The iPhone screen is small enough, take advantage of what little real estate is available and allow us to  rotate to a decent size keyboard.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Well it doesn't have ALL the features ofFacebook on computer, but I'm NOT Always in front of my pc, and I ( unlikeMany people) BUT I DO ALWAYS HAVE MY IPOD! So I can message my friendsMake plans, or just shoot the bull. If you have Facebook on your pc, then why not your iPod or phone or tablet? I give it 5 stars cause I don't have to turn on my PC or laptop just to say hi to my friends! @ least give it a try! Heck, you can even send gifts right to their front door, now how cool is that?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Man, the latest update must be super buggy or something. It crashes wayyyy too often.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is literally useless. It won't even update my news feed.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Does anyone actually test the new apps before they are released? This is full of bugs and totally annoying	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Although this version is much better than previous ones (still many improvements are necessary: when tagging distinguishing between. Being with someone and merely naming them is necessary, for example) I don't get why it crashes so often. And now, I have a permanent red number 1 badge notification despite the fact I have no notifications. Reinstalling the app didn't help. What the what!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It doesn't work (I have a 4S).  The app opens to a blank FB screen, hangs then closes. Reinstalling doesn't help either. Reading other reviews it looks like I am not the only person with this problem. Avoid this version and wait for the next update when this will hopefully be fixed, in the meantime it looks like I'll have to fire up the old PC if I want to check FB...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I can't do ANYTHING without it crashing,lagging, or just freezing. Every time I try to load a picture, it crashes and goes to the homescreen. The message bubble things are retarded. Everything that you add on to this crappy app, lags all of us even more. I don't even wanna rate this app one star because of how slow it is. You minus well just take the app off the AppStore because no one likes it. It's pointless .	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

If you want an app for hours of endless frustration, this is the one to have. It freezes constantly, too much development is spent on dumb features, and I still have no way to change who is viewing my posts... I give up on Facebook's privacy preferences! Facebook, either fix this app for real or forget your updates all together, seriously.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
No way to edit an already posted status. No way to edit a recently added event.  If I post a picture my friends can "Like" "Comment" and "Share" but if I'm posting pictures of my child I don't want other people to share my pictures! And I don't want the friends of my friends to see pictures my pictures just because its been liked.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

AND on top of that its stuck halfway through so I can't even use the app. Get your effin priorities straight. you guys are an embarrassment to technology.

After installing the lasted update, I rebooted my ipad just like I do after I install or update every app.  After the reboot.... The Facebook app icon disappeared.  I cannot uninstall it because there is nothing to uninstall. I cannot download the app again because it says its installed already. I'm at a loss on this.  I now have to use safari to open Facebook online. I have the very latest ipad, it's 6 months old. It's not the ipad.. It's the app. Please fix this issue.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Good app no problems with it I'm on it all day too lol 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
There are still several important features - like highlighting posts of significance the the APP cannot do. The tasks the APP is doing are all functional and OK.Dev. Team: why not just make the APP do what desktop can do? If Fbook doesn't become as good on mobile as on the www employers will close out access to staff; critically decreasing effectiveness of the social platform. Get a move on, you've had enough time!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia

Ever since I upgraded the app all it does Is crash, barely ever loads, and when it does it takes forever to load anything like pictures or videos! It's a bunch of crap and should be fixed. I've talked to a lot of my friend and they agree that they're having the same problems!Total JUNK!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Je sui satisfant	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Functional, but is still not very user friendly.  Have trouble doing even some of the more simpler functions and frequently have to go to standard Web version to make configuration changes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Although I like the new additions the app has to offer, I would say the update really was disappointing! What's the use of the cool features if you don't get to use the app? It literally crashes atleast twice everytime I try to use. The messaging has become really slow and it freezes for a while everytime when someone messages me I try to reply to someone. If someone is still using the previous update, please do not update to this version! I hope a new faster update comes in soon!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Have an iphone 4s? dont upgrade this the new version. Bad Upgrade! c'mon developers!Sure, the GUI is nice.... But the actual function is as slow as snot... Errors on logging in, and is barely functioning on my iPhone 4S!!  It's pretty much useless...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Crashes and is really slow	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Since downloading the latest version, the Facebook app keeps quitting.It would also be really nice if we could have message notifications for all pages.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Are you even listening to us? I updated the app and it STILL CRASHES. Fix this! It's ridiculous. I'm about to stop using the app and just use Safari. FIX THIS.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The recent update you did is awful. The app takes forever to update or it will not even update. Please fix ASAP. Thanks!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
In find friends mode the abbreviated alphabet is no longer on the side to skip ahead to who I'm looking for; the info of when someone is logged in isn't always true--if u want to chat with/send personal message to someone u have to refresh the screen several times before the actual data will update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
App crashes, pictures take forever to load, and when they finally do, it only loads up half the picture. Stop updating fb. You arent helping anyone. Just irritating the worlds population.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's OK. It can definitely be improved though.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

So I was deleting a few profile pictures and in the middle of deleting one, I accidentally pressed the home button and deleted all of my profile pictures I've ever had. Purely Stupid.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's crashed on the I phone 5	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
it's awesome...when it doesn't crash.or when it doesn't erase my comments right after I post them.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
The app as a app works fine. What I think about what Facebook does with it or what they add or don't add is another story. My review is only as asked to rate the app. And that review is it a good app and works fine.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's ok I guess.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Awesome app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Slowing down for updates, pictures not loading anymore or very slowly, last 2 updates made these problems worse for me. Ugh	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
NOT ENOUGH CONTROL OVER YOUR INFO !  ltd options !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Im enjoying the current version with ease and stress less! Congratz FB‰_	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It works better now on my iPhone 4 & love how emotions were added to the app!! The only problem is that is keeps closing itself here and there but not as much as it did before.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Since I updated my facebook it's been all crazy and super slow.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest version now has stupid chat bubbles that cover up parts of the interface. No obvious way to disable this poor design change.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's great I love using this app I am confident it will continue to get better and better! Keep up the good work and thank you for your service!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Unfortunately it's the only decent way to use facebook on a phone/ipad, I hate when I share now on a picture it jumps all over the place, hate that I can't tell if I'm looking at most recent or newsfeed or what, and I especially hate that facebook openly censors and/or manipulates pages that they disagree with politically, I miss the old facebook, back when myspace was still alive, it's too much of a monster now.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the app, but have some issues with it. Some days I open the app and it immediately bumps me out.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Works really well!!! Works better than before  :)	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Could FB be better? Of course! Is it outstanding? In my humble opinion, unquestionably! I use FB daily, sometimes hourly, and it has enriched my life immensely.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love staying connected.  Hate all the changes FB makes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I don't know what's going on with the Facebook app but plenty of trouble updating and the app could not recognize my password.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Crashes every 2 minutes very annoying when I'm typing messages	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
No one likes the landscape mode. No one likes the other useless crap that slows down the software. Fix the stability first then work your way up. The app crashes WAY too much. I can't see an image in a message without the app crashing first. The website is getting useless changes and the pages feature on the app and website is horrible.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
You guys gotta fixing this app... Is a disaster	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Usually when I'm going through a friend's pics, the app will black screen on me. Lags a lot too.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Crashes to much! Super slow! Aggravating!! You would think Facebook number one used app would run better!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
With every large update the app fails to load. Sort of frustrating. This latest update promised a lot of new things, but if it doesn't work ...Its been a few days, please debug it. Thanks.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Is really slow most times and crashes but otherwise love it x	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

No words can say how much I love Facebook. Jk there is one word drama -.- 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I like the convenience of this app, and most of the interface, but it remains slow and crashes a lot. Almost every time I click a picture, it freezes, and it crashes often just opening pictures and links. Also, if I try to play a video, it takes minutes to load and freezes during playback. If I open it safari, it plays fine. Every time there's an update, I get excited thinking maybe they fixed the crashing problem, but it still crashes.....	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Disgusted that this company has so many ties with politicians ($ backing etc...) that have NO respect for our privacy.  In case you forgot NOTHING on the web is sacred.  ESP not on FB, think about it.  All that knowledge of all of us, huge amount of power in that :'-(.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

My only complaint is that they've added so many options that I feel like I'm trying to teach myself how to operate Photoshop :/ ...and why is there still no 'dislike' button?!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This new update won't let me upload pictures, and it won't send pictures from Instagram onto to timeline. Very disappointed! Please fix!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So when I'm scrolling through my newsfeed, and find a post on a friends/liked page I want to read I open it and 2 seconds later Facebook crashes. Then I reopen Facebook set the news feed back to "Most Recent" but it seems that most if not all of the posts I just read have disappeared. If this is facebooks way of saying "sorry for the crashes. Here please start where you left off", its not good enough. Just stop the crashes entirely...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Phone app for facebook is not really good. Apart from uploaded photos easier from phone to facebook... I can't think what else is better on. If u accidentally post something on your phone Facebook just can't delete it unless u use your pc Facebook.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Ipad use typically crashes when I try to follow a link or watch a video... To avoid this I forward into safari.  When i return FB takes me to the most recent news feed post so I lose the post I was interested in and must work all the way down the feeds to find it.  Should have an option to stay where you last read and to scroll up to newest.  Don't like the online and chat bar on the page either. Should have an option to turn that off.  And lastly I don't like all the political censoring by FB.  Shows obvious bias.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's has crashed more than I care to say. They have some more bugs to work out.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Why can't I edit posts? Having to delete a post and re-write it just to correct a spelling mistake seems to be a pretty big flaw.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Privacy IssuesWhen I approve a Friend request PLEASE DO NOT Post it on the Feed for Everyone to see. I Do NOT want everyone to know who I have approved. If they want to dig through y friends list to see that's one thing. But PLEASE do not notify my friends that I've "become" friends with someone. I feel violated. Please make a Setting to stop this or just stop it all together. No one needs to know when people add people as friends **update this please**Not to mention. I'm constantly kicked out still.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pathetic. I can't even get the app to open at all and I've deleted and re-installed it many times and still nothing.! Optimise the app for iPhone 4S and other devices, not just iPhone 5!! It was all working fine until the new updates.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Works pretty good. I like that the feelings & all that got added.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Keeps giving me this weird number of notifications (usually 18, 20, or 21) when actually I have much less or none at all. And it's much slower now...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Glitchy. Doesn't always update comments. Sometimes they erase your posts if political. Timeline gives easy access to your info. Scetchy. Also if you meet a new friend in "real" life and try and "friend" them, without any mutual friends, Facebook punishes you by suspending your friend request feature for 30 days. Lame. Also if you have political or spiritual principles that don't align with fascistbooks views, your account gets edited by the admins. If you friend new and interesting people you don't know, they'll suspend you from friend request for being overly social on their social network.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I wish I could edit and delete comments from the app.. And sometimes it crashes and exits me completely out for no apparent reason.. Irritating.. But overall I love the app and the ease of use that comes with it and I really love the ability to add new albums when uploading pictures :) ... It exits me out while I'm scrolling through and it does that a lot.. I wish it would crash less and work properly more...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Facebook is so easy to use through the app for an iPhone or other apple devices. I like how you can organize your friends into groups and set certain settings for individual people. Facebook  just keeps getting better.- the only thing I do not like is the new message thing where you have to drag the persons little circle to the bottom of the page that's annoying an unnecessary !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook has brought me back to my old friends and lost loves and to keep us all connected. I check it everyday when I wake up and every night before I sleep. I don't think children under a certain age should has access to it though. There are some sick people preying on young men and woman. They should be blocked if they have a sex offender record.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I like this new update! It's easier to talk to your friends, given that the app allows you to speak almost anywhere on Facebook. I signed up for the new newsfeed in March but I'm still waiting for it to appear on my computer. The newsfeed on this new Facebook update looks very clear and and it's easier to navigate around Facebook! The new "Chat heads" chat messaging system is easy to use and is one of the aspects of Facebook, I really enjoy. A fantastic app overall!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Works really well	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes a lot!  Every time I try to post a pic it crashes. I don't like that it won't go into landscape when I turn my phone. Would make it easier to post comments, etc.  I HATE that it constantly goes back to "news feed" when I pick "most recent".	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
With the latest update I now need to tell it to show me all recent posts every time I open the app.  Even then it's not showing me all of my friends' posts.Facebook, please stop trying to tell which of my friends' posts you think are most important.  I will decide that for myself.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is a joke, the newest version on iPhone 5 constantly crashes, it shows you have new messages but won't even load them up, closes when you try to open it & freezes when you try to view pics. If you can deal using browser based Facebook id strongly recommend it, this is a headache you DON'T need!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
latest version worse than the prior...funny how i can do a search in the net one day then there are ads for that search on facebook the next & i had my privacy set so my profile doesn't come up on a google search & now it does...Posts from friends are buried under ads, suggested pages, & app ads...need a similar app to facebook purity that's out for windows pc's...freezes frequently...now the little bubble of a picture of the person who sent a msg?  gotta drag & drop to an X at the bottom of the page to get rid of it...all the updates in the past few months i'd hope the app would get better, not worse...but worse is what it got!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Everytime I open the app, I see a few posts, then it sends me back to the top and then I see two of every post. Can't get notifications, can't comment, can't share, can't see who likes things.

This is a great app connecting but they should make it that u can edit picture such as crop them and rotate it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
This update has a big improvement, since I used to have to start it several times before it loaded up without crashing. Would be better if it didn't try to give me a tutorial on the new chat heads that were in the previous update. But great over all.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Can't share in my page	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Hands down the worst app on my 2 year old iPhone 4. Each update gets worse, crashes, freezes, slower than a 1 legged tortoise and can't even show "most recent" when I select it, let alone remember my choice when returning. Appalling considering the pedigree. Sack your dev team and start again.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I like the update, but it keeps booting me out of Facebook on my iPod -.- and it's very aggravating .	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I hate how i'll like something and then it will automatically update my news feeds and move me to the beginning of them instead of leaving me were I'm at.  Even sometimes it will update and it will move and skip a story or too!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time you guys "fix" or "improve" Facebook you just screw it up!!. This latest version j's by far the worst... You can't see the posts from friends it won't allow me to post anything... You are causing a lot of people to stop using Facebook	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app always crashes and I can't view photos properly either. The photo loads part way then stops or ill try to zoom out to view the entire photo and it snaps back.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Too many f***ing advertisements.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
A very nice way to be in touch with family and friends as well as make new friends. Also a tool to share your faith.'	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Been acting weird. Not opening items correct. Shutting down for no reason. Don't like the new info bar; can't click on options until it goes away	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Slow to respond and load. Gets good then bad quickly	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
No panorama is VERY frustrating. A lot of freezing up then automatically exiting the app... I do like the new option of sharing posts with specific friends, though.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hello, I updated my Facebook and now it takes FOREVER to update..	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
it's slow - it's always been slow - and this new update crashes all the time. how hard is it get it tested properly before hand prior to releasing it ?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
After all the recent updates, it has gotten much slower to load messages and crashes regularly.  This app turning into garbage.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Under the most current update at least, FB crashes completely randomly all the time. It's very annoying. If that one problem was fixed I'd give it 5 stars.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great app!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Got no problem with it just when I open it up and refresh, I get to see my status sometimes...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Notifications no longer updating on app, and my newsfeed isnt updating either.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This latest update is the worst! Click on most recent and get nothing more recent than yesterday.. Pictures don't show, crashes. About ready to unload this app. Sad because I use it all the time...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I think Facebook needs to quit putting blocks on peoples account and quit discriminating against people with Disabilities and people who are conservative and people who are tea party people also please remember Facebook and Mark Zuckerburg are in the tank for Obama if you are a conservative and a tea party person I would highly suggest you go to tea party community and not facebook and facebook still has not taken the 30 day block off my account and needs to ASAP and facebook has allowed porn and allowed a chef to put a page up to promote the killings of cats and dogs by cooking them very sick and has allowed the sex trafficking of young kids and prostituting and bullying on there websites	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Book	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app still shuts down on its own.i hate that it updates automatically when someone posts something new and it scrolls me back to the top. It gets very annoying when I'm reading a post or scrolling through and suddenly have to start from the top again. I also want to be able to unfollow and hide people from my newsfeed using the app instead of having to wait until I can get to a computer.I also hate the photo synching!!! I don't want ALL the pictures I take on my Facebook. If I did I'd post them myself	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebooks been frozen for 8hrs, superwoman slow before update and now isn't working!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Just need to go back to original newsfeed, don't need all that extra, I doubt anyone uses it!!! Other than that the most recent updates are awesome	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

The latest update, the notifications on my home screen are not matching up with the notifications in the app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook won't work on my mobile device (iPod5) since updating to 6.2. No problem on laptop or PC. I have logged off/on a few times, and deleted/reinstalled the app a few times...still not working. Won't allow me to comment or share pics...just continuously shows "updating" but never actually updates. Frustrating.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update messed the whole app up.  Can't click pictures or comments..... Please fix it stinks!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The "most recent" setting only shows me stuff from yesterday. That stuff is not recent.Also, even when I "hide" posts, they show up as soon as I refresh.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
From bad to worst..it was my review of the last two updates. But this new one beats them all. One word: crash	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I love this app <3	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I luv that the moods was added now I don't need 2 jump from my tablet 2 my IPhone 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It closes and I have to open the app again like 3 times . Please so something	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app WAS good..... Now won't even load. Just a blank screen on timeline, no news is bad news. Can only think this has something to do with the latest update as it was running perfectly until I updated the app.As the title says - SORT IT OUT!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Awsome	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
For the most part, I find it difficult to use. If you want to share something the screen, it jumps around and doesn't take you back to where you were. There is no privacy and Facebook colludes with the government to spy on American citizens. I am just glad I didn't fall for the hype and limit my use.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Lately, when I share a link it can be sent once or copied up to 4 times!  What's up with that?  Sometimes changing settings doesn't work.  And I don't want pages recommended to me.  I'm now having to pay to get more followers to see my ranch page.  This is a teeny-tiny ranch and the costs per view are too high.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I use mobile FB all day long however there are many bugs. Crashes too often, especially when adding a pic to 'chk in'. It wud be nice if there was a way to unfollow a post.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Update made this worse..	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ha mejorado bastante, pero sin duda podrÌÁn mejorarla mas, sobre todo en la versiÌ_n que tienen para iPad que en su primera presentaciÌ_n empobrece la aplicaciÌ_n.Pero hablemos quienes tenemos el primer iPad y nos gustarÌ_a la aplicaciÌ_n fuera aun mejor.Gracias!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The last couple of days this app has been insanely slow, all my other apps work completely fine except Facebook, nothings loading and my wifi works fine, this is really annoying	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
For the most part it's great. It's crashed on me a couple times. But not every time I use it	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It crashes sometimes/ freezes	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's always crashing. Won't access any photo folders, only the camera roll. Slow. Fix it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I find that the loading process is slow. The app even kicks me off of it sometimes. All of my updates are current too.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I would like to be able to edit a comment with out having to completely remove what I was writing from my phone. I like the recent addition of share.  I like this update.Still closes unexpectly~	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I've never had any problems with this app and its convenient! Great app!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
FACEBOOK JUST BUG EVERYTING !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Iphone 4- When I open app it takes forever to load content. And then I can't even get notifications unless I open app. Inbox message notifications don't show unless I open it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It does what it needs to do. But. It's very slow, very flaky and constantly changing and more often than not, not for the better. Annoying there is no landscape version. Odd that status updates by friends shared with my gf don't appear on mine but do on hers. And so the list could go on... Oh and NOW the notification overlay that blocks the notification list and then if you don't click it loses the unread status of the notification! Shoddy.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
To be honest,it is rubbish. I downloaded it and it took 5 minutes to load the first time. Suddenly an error appeared and said I had to uninstall an app to keep facebook running clear. So I did what it said and deleted facebook after always waiting minutes for it to load-_-	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Runs way too slow. Takes forever for content to load. Facebook doesn't seem to care to fix it. No wonder the stock is tanking.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is good but you should be able to play Facebook games	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I give it a 3 because it shut down on me  unexpected !!!! And when I want to delete a post on my phone it won't let me do it and I will have to go to a PC to deleted on the Desktop Version	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Why when I go to write a status it automatically brings my pictures up?!  Who wants that?  Ridiculous.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Mine doesn't crash at all :/  great app ......	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Facebook USED to be the bomb.com, however ever since twitter came out, it has definitely spiraled out of control. You all should have kept Facebook the way it was before all that timeline mess you added. Now it's all confusing. What's the point of a timeline for FACEBOOK? You should've remained with the ORIGINAL ideas of Facebook, not this new bs!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I wish I'd never updated my old app, it worked perfectly!  This update tells me I have 32 hits and I'll only have like 3, which is just a minor thing. The real irritation is uploading pix from my photo roll. I'll chose a pix and when I press upload it will upload another pix or sometimes it will have already chosen 5 other pix that I didn't even see. Very aggravating!  Never had this problem with the last update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Okay I love the app But it would be better if you add a video chat feature please I really need it I know that Facebook on a computer has the video chat thing but I need to have it on my iPod/phone	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love the Facebook app, it's easy to use but you need to update again, I'm getting so annoy how it keeps crashing on me when I'm trying to send a friend a message! Or even just loading it, it will crash moments later... Please fix what ever is causing this!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Facebook needs to stop changing.  Other then that it's ok for now. And every time I click out of Facebook I have to resign into Facebook iv never had to do that.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app when it works properly	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I am glad they updated the Facebook app., now it has a share button. The only thing I don't really like is the chat bubbles they are kind of annoying. I do like that you can change your profile pic from the app now, the next thing that should be added is the ability to change your cover photo from the app as well.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love it	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still... Your adding more sh*t before you fix what's broken. Your going from bad to worse. Don't you read your reviews? I see more and more people joining google+ Looks like face books going to be the next myspace. Obsolete!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook won't load since the new up date. It just sits there with that annoying star-loading symbol. Please fix! It's been "updating" my news feed for 6 hours now.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Whenever I open any picture on my timeline, it either crashes the app or takes multiple minutes to load and grant touch screen capabilities again. It's frustrating.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook on iPhone is just bad. There are several important and common features I use that I just can't control from the iPhone, and worse, insane "chat heads" pop up constantly. They are utterly worthless and cannot be turned off. I hate them. I wish Facebook would stop adding features and just make the thing work nicely.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Every time I post something it takes me back to the beginning of the news feed. Also if I want most recent, can it stay on most recent? I'm sick of having to read half of updates through most recent & then comb through news feed to find the rest. Put it back to the way it was an up date or 2 back	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Awsomee	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

When I thought things were getting better, I was wrong. Awful update. Slow, lags when scrolling, crashes, pictures rarely load. I could go on. You need to seriously hire developers that know how to do their jobs. This is getting ridiculous.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This app is horrible! It constantly crashes, it's slow to open, and won't allow me to look at pictures without crashing. Fix it right ASAP!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everything is good, but you can't stay offline in messenger so I don't use it. In-app chat can be done staying offline but the keypad can be used well if it can be rotated. So make the changes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Facebook is really boring now and I feel like Facebook in general needs something more than just a blank blue and white profile, like and comment statuses, and better security in general. The colors are dull and very boring. It should be customizable. Also, a big issue is that it's turned into a part time porn site. Very inappropriate.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app solved a lot of my problems when I accessed Facebook from my iPad.  Before only rarely could I watch a video that someone posted.  Also,  I used to do a continuation comment because my fat fingers used to hit return and post a comment before I was finished.  Easy peasy...problem solved!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love Facebook, but this app always takes too long to load, or it kicks me out of the app, and it freezes constantly. :/ disappointed	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It's good. It crashes here and there but I just think its my iPhone. Doesn't happen on my girlfriends Samsung	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
At first this app was terrific, loved it, no problems. NOW all I get is kicked off all the time. Some of my posts don't show up some photos do show up and I manage a page that logs me out of my wall and asks for a password to my managed page, which by the way are both  on FACEBOOK . I don't get it and no one will contact me back. I. Have written several messages about Facebook freezing and then crashing, and this last one with the page I manage. Not sure I would give this app 3 stars but at least in the beginning, back in 2007, it was pretty good till you started messing with things. Ever heard of don't fix it if its NOT BROKE??? Not happy but this is my vice to keep in touch with my family and all my friends. Leafl	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Likes: - the option of sending a message saying why someone said on you timeline etc.- instant share button- the fact that you can see emojis- the set up of the whole app yet, I would like to see it look alot more like 'Instagram' with the things on the bottom instead of the top? (Just a suggestion) - it doesn't crash as much as it used to, it still does just not as much as the last versionDislikes:- bubble inbox- how long it takes to load a persons page/ comments etc.- it's starting to look like twitter with all the highlighted hash tags - newsfeed could be betterSuggestions: - you should get rid of the bubble inbox, it's annoying and gets in the way all the time and just pops open when someone sends you something- change it to a more similar layout to Instagram - have an option where you can manually view who you want in your personal newsfeedThank you for your time!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

I really wish I could see all posts. Every time!! without having to command it to most recent posts, every time I open the app. Super frustrating.  Also, I don't think it's everyone's business every time I like a post.  No one cares to see that in their feed.  Fix those two things and we're golden.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Honestly, I thought the update would improve things but no. Just added more annoyance to the mix. I'm sick of it being SO slow to load and I'm sorry but does most recent not mean anything to you folk?! Jeez! I used to love fb app and barely used the laptop but you're really taking the mickey these days! Photo sharing is cr@p and most days the app crashes when I open it or, if I'm lucky enough that it doesn't, it will when I try to click on a photo! Sort it out please fb.

Do not download this app. Use Safari and do not support the moribund programmers behind this dreck. Apple is supposedly at the forefront of technological accessibility. Yet their Facebook app, surely one of the most used by iPhone owners worldwide, is trash. It crashes constantly and frequently fails to load when refreshed. There is no reason whatsoever for this app to be so atrocious. If I could sum up my impression of Facebook for iPhone in one word, it would be "pathetic;" given two words, "REALLY pathetic."Update: The "face bubbles" in place of message notifications are preposterous--and it now crashes at least three times daily. This app is so shameful I've considered deleting my Facebook profile altogether. Not the app, my profile. You are failing at success, programmers.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Love the ease of the app, but hate that it crashes, does not show all posts that my friends, and those that I am following, post, and seems to start over on its own.  Also, with latest update, when I share an item, it does not take me back to where I was, but it takes me back to the beginning and changes from Most Recent to News Feed.  Very frustrating!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Now thats what im talkin' it is easy to use the facebook app now more shortcuts and i can upload pics now more fast!! May I suggest try to give a function that you can move photos from album to album and album folder so you can put your personal albums like example:Party albums- xmas party album- new year eve album- my birthday party albumSelf photo album- wearing cosplay- graduation pics- wearing tuxLike that can you do that so we can manage personal album its just like puting same albums in 1 shelfGood day facebook admins	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I am finding the app keeps getting worse. The big update a while back was a major improvement and I thought that was a starting point for it to keep getting better. Instead it keeps getting worse.One example is comments which do not appear even after I get a notification that there is a new comment. I use to be able to refresh comments, but now that is not an option.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The messaging takes FOREVER to update. It won't let me see messages in a group chat even after refreshing the app!!!! It constantly crashes and the iPad layout is very very bad. You need to fix it Facebook!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Anytime I try to switch from page to page, view pictures, or update my news feed it either takes about twenty seconds to do so or it freezes up and suddenly jumps to somewhere I didn't want it to go.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Seriously how has no one said anything about the photos yet? You click a photo and it freezes as it loads and the app locks up. If it doesn't do that, the picture is zoomed in but when you zoom out so you can actually see the whole thing, it just zooms straight back in again. Eventually after a few goes, it stays zoomed out but the damn menu that goes away by tapping the photo so you see it without any disruptions doesn't go away without zooming in the photo again. So many pictures that are big in resolution are not viewable properly it's happened for ages, like over a Year. Don't the developers get over this stupid problem?? Instead of introducing stupid, useless features, fix the basics first and THEN add whatever you want. OMG people!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

The last update for the the app made the layout  for the iPod 5 look good, the launch of the app is still to slow, it launches and it's a blue bar at the top and with a with bottom, still too many buttons, like when we want to view our own profile pic or cover photo, or when we want to logout, no landscape view, and that new picture with a status update would be awesome if you would add it to sharing, and now it seem like I can't get on my account like it took 4 tries to sign into the account and it only shows the loading spinning circle, and I quit out, the multitask close the app and then open it again and it still won't load a thing, and you guys also removed the option to like a page and turn of the ability for us to still like the page, also I have liked a page and I want to go to that page and the app won't let me go to the page because the page "can't be found" but I am still getting news feed from them and that means that page is still active, and I log out of Facebook and it sill keeps me logged in, bring back posting polls from website and bring it to the app	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I don't know why the developers FAIL at this App. It moves slow, the pictures load slow, and I can't even view new stories. Needs to be UPDATED, and the we Facebook users want it to be.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I don't like the way that it posts your post long after they happen and it even freezes up. I hate the way that Facebook has gone and feel you should go back to the old way where there weren't so many problems and people could use it easier. I hate looking in and getting a white screen with blue across the top and nothing else. It's just getting worse to even have the app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
First, I can appreciate that programming for different platforms, such as the web versus mobile, can be daunting. However, over the history of the Facebook app I have found many inconsistencies in terms of incomplete features available on the web versus the mobile versions. Also, recently there appeared to be some type of dynamic updates going on behind-the-scenes that were causing multiple crashes.  I sometimes get the sense that the team that develops for the web does not work with the team that develops for mobile.It is my hopes that Facebook will take the mobile app to higher, more consistent and stable grounds.   I also highly encourage Facebook Inc. to consider a beta program. This is standard development practice.  They can enlist the help of hundreds of thousands of users to test features  and provide feedback on usability prior to releasing them into production.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I would prefer it if they stopped tinkering, they think it's going to make Facebook better, but that rarely happens! Security and privacy still wary about, and it seems that they adopt other social networks ideas. Here's a tip, what works for others, won't necessarily work here!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

I find myself using the app more hen the site.  However, it crashes every now and then.  They need to work on that.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes, too many updates, message bubble is annoying. It's hard to read a post because if something new shows up in the feed or you "like" a post or comment the feed scrolls back to the top. Now there's this annoying thing that opens up to add a picture even if you just want to post a simple comment in your status. I think I'm just going to use the web version. This is a royal pain. :-/	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sorry guys but someone failed on this new FB app.  Please bring back the old version.  Sometimes simple is better.  The more you mess with it the worse it seems to get.  You use to be able to start a message and leave it for a minute to do something else but now when you go back your half written message is gone and you have to begin all over again.  Getting too much garbage in newsfeed that I didn't request or "like".  What on earth is Candy Crush!  Don't want it, need it or want to see it!  Newsfeed isn't updating any longer unless you log out and log in again. Can't search for new friends any more.  Use to love FB but check your recent ratings guys, everyone's complaining sorry to say.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

This newest version is awful!! Why change it when it was fine the way it was. I have to take time to figure out where the hell everything is again. Stop messing with it! Put it back the way it was. I hate all of the info being at the bottom, it was better at the top! It's also closing out all the time. It drives me crazy. It's not good, I hate it!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
All these new features make browsing FB way harder than before. For one thing I can't exit out of the app to view my sms because the app starts over from the beginning of the newsfeed when I go back to it?!

Ever since the update, it freezes or lags when I try to see images. Also, when I go to neck my notifications, it doesn't load properly. For example, my friend invited me to an event page and it won't load.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works great.  Occasional rare crash. Facebook does do strange things to its newsfeed but the app itself is fine.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Horrible. Each update makes it worse. I will be in the middle of something and it kicks me out of facebook all together and I have to log in all over again.  Navigation stinks. It won't let you re-post or share posts the way I want or to someone else's wall like it does on the pc version.  Sending photos or posts in a private message is difficult pr not even a possible option. You are unable to customize who can see your posts.  You are unable to exclude a certain person from seeing your post. New posts are mixed in with older posts so you have to go thru posts you have already read to view the new stuff. It doesn't allow you to sort your news feed according to either most recent or by posts based on interests like the pc facebook does.  I only use the phone app when I don't have access to a pc now because I hate the new app changes and the user unfriendliness it is becoming	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Congratulations! The only thing you've succeeded at was making this update worse than the last one! I constantly get "Tap to retry" errors; when I scroll the view my news feed, it suddenly crashes and closes; it's slow as Hell; and the checkmarks are so stupid.

Facebook is Facebook. I've had it for years. But now a days there are wayyyy too many crashes. It'll just log out and shut the whole app down. I will never leave Facebook sadly.

This FB is more responsive, but it also is more restrictive in what you can say politically. The truth hurts sometimes, but you need to be able to tell it. On the other hand I would like to see vulgar language flagged. When it updates or refreshes you have to wait for the action to finish what you are doing. It is a good way for people to exchange ideas and keep the democratic process alive. This version updates a lot and holds up the actions like share or comment.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Please stop updating Facebook. PLEASE. If you guys truly go through with the hashtag idea, I think I will be deleting my account. You're losing your originality...you're losing the essence you began with, the essence of social media by blending with other social media outlets desperately trying to match their developments. A year ago I would have given you 5 stars. 6 months ago, 4, today I give you 2 based on exasperation from the constant alterations and in dread of your promise to rival twitter with hashtags. Don't do it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Takes three plus tries to open the app. Constantly switches from most recent to top stories whenever it wants. Also if you login for example at 4pm then dont login until 11pm that night all the stories that happened from 4pm-11pm wont show up unless at all. Im just deleting this crap and sticking to PC.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very good but still will like to be able to delete comments once posted.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Buggy and news feed is stupid. Bring back most recent... Not this top story BS.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I use interest lists to keep up with my Facebook feed, but this latest redesign makes it almost impossible to use them.I can choose the list and start scrolling and reading no problem. But heaven forbid I need to put down my phone for a second or want to re-share something I find. Unlike the previous version, this one flips you back to the top of the feed instead of saving where you were last when you return to the feed. Very frustrating.At least they seemed to have fixed to constant crashing with this update, that's what the single star is for.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

What the heck is wrong with this app?! Can't even access my page. Posts duplicate on newsfeed. Can't open friends' photos. Can't comment on friends' posts. Bad, bad update.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
La aplicaciÌ_n se cierra por abrir el chat, o abrir una imagen, muy mala aplicaciÌ_n, mejor usen Safari para checar Facebook	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Wish I could rate it zero stars.Open app and it crashes so I have to open it again...happens EVERY TIME I open it. Wish I could make a  with an unhappy face. Mark Zuckerberg needs to hire a 12 year old kid to rebuild this app from scratch. Whoever is doing it now spends all their time making it pretty instead of making it work correctly and stable.

I love Facebook and this app has ruined it, when I'm listening to music and I click on a video to watch it on Facebook, the music obviously goes off, but when I want to listen to the music again it won't let me because the video hasn't stopped, also on the old update when you wanted to stop watching the video you could just scroll up or down away from the video, but it still plays, sort it out mate.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Dumb update, it will sometimes crash when I try typing a message or sending a picture with my messages, sometimes lags when I comment in a post with a photo, but overall it's a pretty good app, just fix the crashes and the lagging.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

For the most part the app has improved a great amount, but I find myself having to reopen FB after crashing several times a day. as a person who used FB a lot, this has brought me plenty of aggravation. I've been in several positions where I would write a long message, look through news feed, or scroll through pictures, and the app would just close on me. aggravating right?! Please fix bugs.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The new update is not user friendly and is super confusing. Facebook needs to stop "fixing" things that aren't broken before they become they land themselves in the social media grave yard like MySpace	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The App shuts down for no apparent reason several times during use. I also get warnings I've got notifications and yet when I go on I have none.

This current version of the app is so slow! If you try and refresh the news feed to actually view 'most recent' stories the app just stalls and hangs and leaves you viewing the same stories you've seen the last 10 times you've opened the app! Also photos + their comments are always 'loading' but never actually 'load'...very annoying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Does Facebook have a new format on iPhones? my friend just updated his fb app earlier and his fb format looks diff than mine (his format looks new). Is this a bug or something?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everyone who hates it. Forget you it's amazing. I haven't had a problem with it crashing one bit (Maybe u all hate it because u have the iPhone 3GS) the hardware on the old iPhones can't handle the software the new Facebook has so maybe u people need to buy new phones! (I'd prefer the 4S or the 5) so u guys shush up and get new phones. Now I will admit it can crash sometimes but I honestly don't have a problem with it. All they need to do is in the next update, they need to allow the messaging bubbles outside the app and into the Home Screen and all the other 800,000 apps out there. So I won't have to leave the app I'm currently on and go to Facebook just to reply to my friend I'm messaging.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This most recent update is much cleaner and more user-friendly than it was in the past, but STILL NO LANDSCAPE VIEW AVAILABLE (except in photos). WHY? Is it beyond the developers' capabilities? So many people have asked for this simple feature, but you ignore the requests and then expect good ratings?(21-06-2013)*****Seriously? Another update and you still won't bring back landscape view despite countless people's requests? You used to have it, so it's possible. Maybe it's time to hire some new developers.(06-11-2012)*****So many people asked to have the landscape view brought back. Another update and still this isn't fixed. Why not? It's time consuming and frustrating to use, now. Disappointed.(22-09-2012)*****This is actually a REALLY good update - the best yet - but there's one thing missing: there's no longer a landscape view available. I have always turned my iPhone sideways as it makes it a lot easier to type this way, but this option is no more, and I now have a cramp in my arm as a result. If you can bring the landscape option back, I'll give you five stars. :)By the way, it's SO much better without the photo tags showing up all the time, and the updates are excellent! Really pleased overall. Thanks!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

I remember when Facebook just came  out. I mean everybody at the time was using MySpace. We all left their and went to Facebook, and it was great to begin with. But yeah.... Everything has changed, We started following twitters example with hashtag, Facebook only had one original idea and it was Facebook. Don't get me wrong I love Facebook it's a good way to stay connected but still. I will say this and then I'll shut up, I really like how now you can do feelings. And if your notifications keep popping up just go to your settings and turn it off to where doesn't show how many notifications you have. It gets less annoying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
We complain and complain, and you listen!  Thanks guys. This last update works better than great. Did you guys just set out expectations low in purpose?  Seriously, great job!No problems with login, newsfeed update, picture viewing, or commenting. Happy!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

It's ok, sometimes it's crashes but its ok. And also, you should do option in messages others, coz I can check them on laptop, but I can't see them on iPhone5	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
When loading the news feed it doesn't give the status' in order. At the top will be from yesterday and as I scroll down il have ones from 5 minutes ago. Very annoying. Very slow when loading. When loading the application open it just closes for no reason then doesn't let me reopen for the next 2/3 attempts. Awful	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
WHY did you remove the availability to share from your feed to a group? grrrrr The app is easy to use but you keep changing things and taking useful things away. STOP IT! Being able to play all the games on mobile that one plays on the full site would be nice. Because you took away something I liked, I took away a star.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Drives me mad but I love the app :)	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Your updates are crap. You constantly add and change things but never actually FIX anything. I wish I could give you NO STARS!This app crashes and force closes randomly. Sometimes immediately, sometimes after having it open for 5 minutes. You seriously need to figure out what's wrong first, then add and play with whatever else you feel like doing.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
FINALLY, an update that doesn't crash! Thanks for finally writing an app that works well with the iPod Touch 4g. I only had to wait for about 7 updates to get from one stable version to another stable one.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
There seems to be an ever increasing problem in this app of keeping things in chronological order. I've got posts from several days past appearing at the top of my posts.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Pretty functional.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada

I can't get it to refresh the feed since the update i have to uninstall and then reinstall!  I have just been using the browser for Facebook.  Hope there is a fix soon because this is a pain!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hate that you can't see "recent post by others" on groups!!!! HATE!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Since the last app update, FB won't update content on my iPad. It opens, says its updating, and just keeps thinking whilst it is 'updating'. And nothing updates. I have no new news/posts after Wednesday 19th June.  It works fine on the home PC though. VERY annoyed!First time I've ever left a review also and finding this hard to do due to requirement of a nickname, and finding one that has not been used by someone else!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
The only thing that needs to be changed/added etc is being able to delete a comment	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
I Love The New Facebook , especially how you can say how you feellibg . But it would be better if we could of change it to w.e color we want .	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's all pretty good until it comes to checking in. It's taken away the option of not having GPS on, and you also can't add places just for fun	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Can't post from my iPhone to page a manage anymore. :( How can I go back to the last version??!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
When loading the app, it's extremely laggy and just shows it loading, I updated it after the App Store notified me to update Facebook, I updated it now the app doesn't even work compared to what it did before the update was released, it's a fix that need doing and fast	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
For what it's worth it's a great app. Only negative is that occasionally when I open it and its loading it'll just shut down so I have to reopen. Other than that no problem does the job fine	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
It's really too bad I like using Facebook but the updates don't seem to work and it knocks out my whole phone. Also now all of a sudden people I don't even know can add me as a friend without my approval so I have to block them.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I like it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Before i did the update i was perfectly fine, now when updating a status facebook keeps telling me to learn more from my update, its annoying me now!!! Also, my pictures are missing round the edges! Sort it out, feel to just use the crappy internet fb!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Good for apple I suppose. But mine tends to just randomly go off when I'm In the middle of Inboxing someone or commenting on a status, also all the buttons on it are getting to be ridiculous should go back to straight forward simple facebook no buttons no stickers just simple facebook..	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
good	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can't even download the updated app so now I can't even get on Facebook real good guys what is the problem!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Crashed when opening the MSG chat box.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The worst update yet. When commenting on my own posts or others posts the comment disappears right before my eyes when I press post button. Ridiculous. Also what was so wrong with having a friends list that was in alphabetical order. Why should I have to do a search for my own friends in my own friends list. When a photo is tapped for full view it's really glitchy & not a smooth change. Quite annoying actually. App randomly crashes on iphone 4s with latest software update.These are my main issues with app that I can remember at the moment. You've really lost the plot this time. 0 stars is way too high. Negative 10 stars at best.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
The latest version has a bug where I can't see comments in posts anymore.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
This is getting old. Update after update and you still fail to fix the crash issue. Geez.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I love it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
The app has improved. I like the share post function. However it leaves out some of the best features like the edit post function.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Amazing. I use Facebook everyday but it would be nice if we were able to see what our friends post, and what the pages post, on like some sort of different timeline. Or have a tab for friends posts and one for the pages that we like. I miss what my actual friends post because the pages post too much. That is my only issue and besides the games, that is it.Love, this frequent and forever user.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Well sometimes the photos do load slow although I have the fastest wifi cox offers, and LTE when not at home. Plus I have crashing issues at least 3-4 times a week. Otherwise it's ok. iPhone 5	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Hate how it bounces around . Updates usually mean trouble but I always hope for the best that the issues will be resolved... Silly me the updates just have different issues !! There have been a few versions in the last 100 updates that actually worked properly . Any reason there are always stupid changes that don't even work ? Try fixing the issues and not try to make it different .	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It almost always crashes wen I first try to get on n sum times takes pics 4ever to post.  Other than that it alright.  No biggie!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Great app for the most part. I've heard some complaints but I haven't had any issues since I downloaded it. It would be nice if news feeds and updates were quicker but beside that ....worth it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Would be nice if this app didn't crash so much. Plus when you post that your post don't disappear and post correctly. Other than that, it's a pretty good app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

It's incredibly slow with the new update, it used to be rapid. Doesn't upload the newsfeed anymore. It cuts off the picture edge whenever I load a photo. Was this even tested before release? Don't update!!!!!!!!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I do not like that I cannot set my default view on my iPhone to Most Recent. You guys need to consider fixing that.  Also, I have noticed that when I share something, my most recent timeline removes a large portion of things that were just there. I have to be sure to go all the way back to the last time I looked at Facebook or I miss the chance to see many updates (about 12 hours worth of info disappears).	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm sure we will all get used to the bottom navigation bar, but this constant crashing of the app is unacceptable. Also, when I am scrolling through my feed, it will randomly just back to the top. Sometimes I've scrolled through DAYS of posts, and when it jumps tithe top 1) I lose my place and 2) my phone has to reload all pics/vids and links! What's more is, Facebook seems to be taking extra long to load pictures and other content.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I can't even open Facebook without it crashing sometimes up to 5 times, I am having problems with messages loading and it's down right attrocious!! I'm so sick of you not getting it right and each update being worse than the last! For such a common app one would expect far better!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Easier to change the privacy settings on a post.Harder, if not impossible, to share things on a page you manage or on a friends's wall.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
For the most part I like the Facebook app. The one thing I would add, however, is to option to search for things within a group page. I run into the issue of wanting to find something on a page and not be able to find it very easily due to not having that available to me.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The pictures are great and it's apt faster, the only thing I have a problem with is the print somehow on the latest version is so much smaller and because I have glaucoma it is very hard fore to read the post ! This is the only way I can keep in touch with my Son who is in Afghanistan he is USA Navy and my second son David is in Japan ( Air Force) and my third son is on the other side of the United States from me he is a Minister in the Church ! My Sons travel all over and this is my form of communication with them , I'm 70 yrs old and have a great need to stay in touch with Momma's Boys !

I like being connected socially and this app fills that need. I don't find a lot of bugs with it despite how many times I'm prompted to update the app. Then again I'm not doing a lot of posting or sharing just a lot of Facebook creeping.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Every time I open Facebook it either closes or doesn't load. When im writing someone it close down and delete the messages. It's always closing on. I'm having to reopen it. A lot. It makes me not even wanna use this app. This needs to be fixed and fast .	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love that y'all did the emotions now with the iPhone app. Just need to get the event page more up to date like the Mobile app. You can't edit it from the iPhone app. I still have to go to the desk top or mobile app to do a lot of things	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Since the last Facebook "upgrade", I find it impossible to navigate pages or receive updates in a timely matter.  Add to that the constant crashing, I'd give this the worst review I have ever written.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Like the title says	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Bug fixes??? How about bug infestation? I've had to delete & reload FB from my phone 3 times in 2 days. It won't load. For the love of all things good & lovely in the world.... Fix it then leave it alone! We don't need updates every other day.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I don't know what's going on with the new updates to Facebook mobile devices (iPad & iPhone), but I think they are the pits. Response time is slower than before. Is there a way I can go back to the previous version? We can no longer delete messages from mobile devices? I actually liked that feature.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Keeps crashing when I'm chatting, sometimes it crash while checking notifications... Please fix! It used to work perfectly for iPhone 5	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Previous update took away landscape mode, this one screws up timeline order. I just access thru safari.  Lol guess I'll just add on to my previous review.

Come on guys, this company is loaded, you can't do any better than this? I know technical difficulties happen, but this has been far too long. I'd give it 0 stars but it won't allow that (go figure), so 1 it is I suppose.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This app is brilliant but the updates seem pointless as they don't solve the biggest problem which is if you scroll too fast down your newsfeed or even click on a Facebook profile that it has difficulty in loading it will just cut you off, which is annoying when your half way through reading or commenting and it puts you back to your newsfeed :(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

The process of searching a new friend and a new page is too slow!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Doesn't let me see comments and crashes every other time I open it. The updates keep making it worse. I have resorted to just using safari.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes constantly when messaging on my 4s. Hangs periodically. Takes way too long to load from the lock screen.The new update doesn't fix any of the above bugs, but adds the "feature" that messages sometimes won't open at all.Aren't you supposed to know how to do this app development thing, Facebook?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I think the app is pretty good.  It occasionally forces itself closed, but it starts right back up.  It's easy to log-in and out if needed.  I like that I can open links right in the app without my Internet pages opening, but I do wish it was more clear on which arrows control the navigation of the link and which take me back to Facebook.  Otherwise, it works great for me!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
New update sinks!!!!!! I can't update my "most recent" newsfeed at all, (its constantly trying to update, but to no avail) can't see any new notifications, I can't see my own posts or page!! Even uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times, updates once then no more "new" stories...until I shut off my phone or uninstall and reinstall!!!!:( fix this ASAP!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very Good :))	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
How are you going to market an app for such a huge audience and have it not even work? Constantly crashes, never loads new stories, freezes 9 times out of 10 when I push any button or swipe. This is on a brand new phone that every other app works brilliantly on. I could write a better app when I'm drunk. Delete	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The last 2 updates just made it worst. It crashes every 5 mins or so. When u share omething it takes u back to the top of the page. Its really annoying. Gotta fix this app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Have tried about fifteen times to update this app but it keeps telling me there's an error message. No matter what I do to try to make it work, now I can't use this at all. Stop the constant updates and give us something consistent that's going to last a while. Also, get rid of the bubbles when someone sends us a message. The simple numbers at the top of the screen were all we needed.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I find that using the mobile version is very limited. It seems to crash or freeze quite a bit too. Still love it. Keep improving please.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Don't understand the really negative reviews, this app works beautifully for me and I've never had many problems with it. The only thing that holds back the extra star is that the security features on the app still don't fully match the browser version, which is a bit annoying. But otherwise, it's great!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

The last updates make it extremely hard to view your newsfeed. As soon as you share something, it automatically scrolls up to the top. Meaning, you have to start over again, and again, and again. Absolutely assinine!Between the above and the frequent crashes, it's very difficult to use.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest update brought things to a screeching halt. News feed and status updates moving at a snails pace. I can walk to my office and log into my computer faster than navigating the app. Please fix this!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I always get blocked by Facebook when I send out requests to people I know or people are related to me by marriage. Wished this would stop. If I didn't know the person then I wouldn't send any requests.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Don't try to force me to add a picture to my status update.  That's why there are two separate options.  SMH..  Scrolling is painfully slow.  And no option to edit a comment or status, just delete it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ok. It's nicer to open FB app than to log in all the time in Safari. Why did the "Share to Group or Page" option suddenly disappear?! Normally I'd give leeway to an app, but FB is now FULLY integrated into the iPhone itself. Keep up. Seriously.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app keeps crashing just about over it already.Fix bugs or I'm uninstalling what sense does it make to have it if cant use it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
So every time Facebook is open and I get a mail or notification it freezes then fully shuts down the app and takes a few moments to load again. Constantly freezes and crashed upon trying to launch app. When the app is closed it'll tell me I have a random number of notifications (for example it'll say I have 20 notifications when I have 2mails.) chat freezes. Videos never upload upon first try, if they do upload at all that is.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Used the new update for 4 minutes; the app crashes once and I am no longer able to see when people have replied to comments on pages I follow.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

FB used to be so fun and fast to work with. Now with all the new updates lately it is so so slow. People now have so much fun to block you from seeing or commenting when ever they desire to, and that took all enjoyment out of FB for me and others I know. I get knocked off and have to restart and sometimes have to even sign in again. It even drains my battery just waiting to open a notification or any other pages of my FB sites. It doesn't get much better, just gets worse where now I don't even like much of evening looking at FB anymore. All the fun has gone out of it. I keep having to delete my app and download again just to pick up some speed on it, then within 10 minutes its so slow again.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Never know what will appear on newsfeed. There is no consistency with what appears. Posts change every time I open, keeping in the same sort mode.

Update: Seriously, why wont the news feed stay in the mode I choose until I decide to change it? EVERY time I go back to the app I have to choose "most recent." Although even that isn't working well; "most recent" currently has a handful of posts from the past 20 minutes and then jumps to five hours ago. "News feed" just jumps all around in time. Going back to Safari for now. Love the new look and the choices for news feed. But please quit reverting back to what appears to be your idea of the most important posts. If I choose "most recent," I want it to stay there until I change it. Why you would use "top stories" is beyond me; it ends up showing me the same posts I saw hours ago over and over. Should be "most recent" by default; that's the only way to be sure you're seeing everything you want to see. Especially annoying when you're trying to keep up with news posts during breaking news. There is also an annoying delay in loading the news feed choices, so when I scroll up to change to most recent, I end up clicking on something I didn't mean to and have to go back and choose it again. Wasting a lot of time with this new setup.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is so/so u can't copy the text, fascist book (facebook) censors posts, sanctions u if u friend to many people, post to too many groups whom u belong.

App throws you out. Long times to load photos.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not only does this app crash continuously, but the functionality is very confusing and poorly thought out.-Notifications get "stuck" in that you sometimes have a mystery number on the icon. -Sharing web addresses in chat window is shaky at best as the sometimes don't send or show up, leading you to ask the recipient if they actually got it. -Setting up photo albums and editing them is nearly impossible.-Timeline updates are very unreliable as well, randomly hiding posts or posting out of order.-Organizing friends is also difficult, and removing someone from favorites is done automatically rather than something you can control.-Double listing for "other friends"You are better off using the browser on your mobile.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

At last! An update that is actually an improvement!!! After about six awful "updates," the app is finally somewhat functional again!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Will not open or load. The only reason at all that I still have this app is because you do not have competition. A total disappointment. Spend less time adding things that slow the app down and more time making it simple to use. I don't need to run actual Facebook I have a computer for that keep it simple stupid!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

What is extremely annoying is the app will tell me I have 12-13 notification, but when I go to it, I only have 1-2.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Every single time I go into my inbox and start writing a message, 3/4 times I get halfway through a massive paragraph message and the entire app just closes and I lose my message! Make it save the message automatically!The "sent at xx" is really annoying, every time I click the sidebar it says I have a message and I have to go through everything to find out if I actually do and it's just really frustrating to deal with "sent" "sent" every single message I need to check.The "most recent" is all I want it set to, not every single time I have to click all of them to get rid of the 20+ on "News Feed", "Top Stores" and usually "Most Recent" shows top stories, so you have to close out and re-open.The chat bubbles, worst idea yet... They constantly bug out, if you click to open them they sometimes open and close and vice-versa, the limit is 4? Why not have them loaded down the side so you can have more than that?Everything else with the app is okay, there's no editing option for photo captions, shouldn't be too hard to add right?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Loving the new update which lets you add an emotion or what you're doing. Still not liking that I can't use it if I turn the screen. It use to rotate with the phone and now it doesn't.

First off, I have an awesome Iphone 4 and have zero issues with it. Ihated the updates so much due to their lack of compatibility that I deleted it all together. This app crashes at the click of anything from messaging, adding photos, leaving comments to simply scrolling through the news feed. I am currently downloading it again to verify whether or not its the updates onto the old app and if it betters with a new download all together.  We shall see but I'm truly not optimistic as this app has epically failed worse and worse following each update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am really happy that "feelings" etc can now be added to statuses via the app. But a little disappointed at the very small amount of feelings available and the inability to create your own with an emoticon you choose.. )	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

I never review apps. I find the process tedious. But for this stupid app I will make an exception. FB is a necessity but they can't seem to get something as basic as their app correct right now. It crashes constantly. It drives me nuts. It will crash mid-conversation. It will crash when uploading a photo. Forget trying to take a photo via the Facebook app. Crashes. Want to post on a friends wall? Nope. Sorry. Crash. Stupid. Fix these things before making the app fancier and more liable to crash stupid FB.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I use FB for news and other articles and the screen stopped the rotation feature some time back and that means I can no longer expand the text to a size my 65 year old eyes can read. As a result I turn to Twitter as their screen still rotates to landscape allowing expansion of the text.The sort feature doesn't work as it once did. It sorts itself to most popular but my interest is most recent. My daily status posts sometimes take several hours to days to appear and then they are one right after the other. Pages used to be easy to find and follow but with the changes I haven't been able to find new pages I'm interested. Fortunately, so far, new pages are also on Twitter so can read them there.Searching for individuals has also become more complex and frustrating so I've given up.I'm getting more and more ads from companies themselves or posted by friends. Typically 3 businesses will be grouped in one status update. Sometimes a friend's name will be listed as making a recommendation of the biz or product but this makes no sense as some are not in the area in which my friends and I reside.And then this thing of 'XYZ may post on your behalf' is ridiculous. I'm 100% able to post myself. Why would I want someone else do it for me?Facebook should just drop the mobile app and stick with the computer. FB has lost to Twitter.March 2013: Considering dropping FB completely.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Well, the last update stopped the crashing at the price of ALWAYS losing your place in the newsfeed when you come back. Want to look at that link more carefully? Do t do it if you want to stay where you're at in the newsfeed! It makes the app almost worthless.Facebook, the solution is simple: GET RID OF THE AUTOMATIC REFRESHING OF THE NEWSFEED!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Facebook is fun and cute but they keep changing things once you've gotten used to a certain way. And the privacy issues keep getting more and more compromising. And WHAT business offers NO REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE??!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Absolutely love all the new updates for this app ... Can't live without facebk and keeping up with friends and familyAlso would be a lot more awesome ifTheir were theme colors for the page itself like the covers !!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

My issues. It says there are 11,15,10 notifications, I open it up, there's 2. Maybe 5. What the hell. Second. I can copy someone's comment, but not a post? Really? The whole idea is to be able to copy paste some of those FB chain posts "don't share, copy paste please". I would with a few I really like, but I'm not opening my freaking slow computer just to copy paste a status! Otherwise, pretty good in my opinion.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I hate it it stay messing up my phone	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a great app. It allows people to stay connected. Lets others be part of a special time. Should be more elderly-people-friendly. The easier to use the more people could enjoy it. Make it simple but have great features like hashtags so one could discuss desired topics. Thank you Facebook.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Upgrades are cool. Just crashes a lot and bugs	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

You guys really do not need to update every two weeks when you do the app users suffer more and more people messages pop up outta order even when you tap most recent . Go back to an older version please	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's been crashing way too much lately :/	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With every update and tweak they make, this application gets worse. I would have given it zero stars if that had been allowed.The worst is that the stories in the newsfeed were often different than in the "most recent" feed.Also, when I simply look at Facebook through the mobile site, I see many posts that I did not see through the application. So what's the point of having it, if it's not sharing items I'd like to view?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm getting more and more annoyed with Facebook crashing! Every time I try to click on an article link within the app, it crashes!!!! What the hell? Maybe you can submit an update that actually FIXES the friggin' problem!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I like the new updates. Thanks for the updates!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It lags, crashes on occasion, doesn't post/delete photos or statuses properly, and it doesn't show the correct amount of time people have been idle/active.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Completely worthless and unusable.  Not only has it not worked right for the past year, but it appears to be a danger to my phone. I downloaded the latest update. When I tried to use it and it locked up my phone. Was able to do a hard shut down. Thought it might not start back up. Not good.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is only my opinion, of course.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I use this app everytime I go on Facebook, I don't even use my computer anymore.It's easy to so use. I love being able to share pics, private messaging....  It's all so easy with this app.If you don't already have it, you should get it!!The only problem I have is, changing my cover picture. I can't do it from this app. If I could do that, I'd give the app 5 stars.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I recently got the app and it's crashes about 20+ a day on me. It's also really slow and can't take all the information which contributes to the crashing. Also, after the recent update, I don't get any of my messages when someone PM's me. It shows me notifications when I get messages, but when I check there's nothing. And when it does show, it comes around a half an hour or two hours at the most to send me my PM. It's really annoying because what's the use of having the app of I can't even use it :\?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love it , but what happen to Copy & Past?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This update looked excellent at first but now I recon it the worst one I lose comments, notification sounds for comments and only chat messages and it keeps resetting itself I wouldn't waste your time with it and losing comments this was good at first but now it a lot worse than all the other updates And I have to keep logging out then back in because u can not refresh status's like before a totally waste of time , DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!This app has slowed my iPhone down and causes it to crash the you tube app integrated in the Facebook app and it crashes my phone :-( and can not open messages as it causes the app to crash this app is getting worse and worse it needs sorting out big time and signs you out all the time , it keeps crashing when I try to view events to see who's birthday it is etc this app is getting worse and worse not better I would not waste your time getting it , I thought they would of at least brought an update to fix all these things that are now wrong with it  I find the FB app on iPhone has gone exactly how it used to be on a blackberry and now they have changed around and if the app didn't kill my battery so much on my blackberry I would most certainly be using that for the FB app as it so easy to use now like the app used to be like on iPhone but its turned into a joke on iPhone leg me tell you , now I can't even scroll back to see past posts from last night this app is getting worse and worse do not waste your time installing it, when are you going to repair the glitch when you try to open the events tab or you just going to leave it crash and send you back to the home screen ? Even crashes now when opening pictures needs sorting out big time !!!! Now missing even more comments , sort it out FACEBOOK!!!!!!! And I've just noticed that my pics that I once set to private are no longer private since update ! This app has so many things going wrong for it , I wouldn't waste you time it crashes all the time if u want to delete inbox messages it only lets u do it one at a time you can't change cover picture events feature in app crashes the app this app should of been left as it was years ago !! Total and utter garbage now !! :-( and need to install a comment removal back just like how it used to and an un follow function to, and did I say that you lose comments on status's should nvr of touched it and not try to fix something if it ain't broken!!!! This update that's just been released don't get it its complete and utter crap I'm glad I got a blackberry to use Facebook as the app for blackberry's is now like the way it was for iPhone before they started playing around with it , you lose comments , click on notifications then click on the notification and you see that people have liked you're comment which you can no longer view even tho you wrote it home page doesn't keep to same feed as you want it keeps changing to default , this app is getting worse and worse by the updates and it needs a unfollow tab in status's	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
When I open it, it crashes and I have to touch the app again. That's most of the time but when it finally loads, it stays there and doesn't crash.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I like this app except for the fact that it keeps crashing on my first gen iPad... When it doesn't crash, it does provide for most of the features that I can get to from the full site; however, I find it EXTREMELY annoying that I Can't edit a post to a custom privacy from iPad app.  For instance if I post something to all my friends, and decide I want it to be all of my friends minus a group I have created, i got edit the privacy, but it WON'T bring up the window to select who I include and who I exclude.  You only have the option to use prechosen filters.  It is extremely annoying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
My navigation bar has been displaying as a tab bar for 2 releases now and will not return to its panel-nav position. I haven't been able to find how to fix it and re-installing isn't resolving the issue.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm extremely disappointed with this latest update. I don't give a crap about adding "feeling happy" to my post when you take away the option to share from a mobile device to a page we manage. I am completely happy in deleting this app all together if I cannot share to pages.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Crashes and freezes a lot.!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand

This app takes FOREVER to load notifications and other basic features. It is way too bloated. I want speed with a mobile app. I don't need every single feature the full site has, just the essentials for a speedy and efficient mobile app. Needs to be stripped way down or rebuilt.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Honestly Facebook, get your act together. Why is it that just about every other company can make a FUNCTIONAL app except you guys? I expect better from you people. I'm not messing around. Fix this.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook where you can follow people you haven't seen in years, meet people that you never would have met otherwise, now I cannot imagine not having those people in my life. I keep track of what is going on in the town where I grew up. My brother lives in Japan when they have earthquakes I can know in minutes that he is ok. I love Facebook, I cannot imagine a time without it. I know it is not popular to love Facebook, but I really do. Is it perfect? Maybe not, but it is so much better then anything out there. Think of all that the talent that has gone into Facebook. They are constantly evolving and getting better. Thank you Mark Zuckerberg, I really appreciate all that done.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I can't use it longer than five minutes without having to reopen the app and retype the post/chat/comment I was just typing. I mostly FB from my phone, so this is killing me.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Can't edit status updates. Can't delete status updates. I don't want to be told which stories are my "top" stories. I want to see every status update individually by ALL my friends and liked pages. I don't want them lumped together when they contain similar wording. It crashes. After it crashes I have to start all over.Also, Not very secure. Facebook "decides" which stories or status updates are "important". Some updates are stupid. Did I mention not very secure?! There are constantly warnings about loopholes that make your personal information less and less private and safe. If it weren't for trying to keep in touch with family I wouldn't use it. Still contemplating what steps I want to take to delete it. I want to save all my statuses first. Facebook needs to address its safety. Not be so vague. Write things in "English" that people can actually understand not in legal bill crap that makes no sense.I don't like that my photos can be saved by other people and shared. Facebook for me is a very personal and private place. I have a very limited amount of friends. I do it that way on purpose. I don't Like having apps and other people having access to my personal life. I refuse to link any game or app to Facebook. I avoid it at all costs. I don't want games suggested, I don't want to see games other people play. I don't want to see advertisements!!! The list goes on. I only use Facebook to keep in touch with family. If I have to I will seek alternatives. This just isn't safe. Or user friendly.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The only thing I like about the new Facebook is the stickers. I don't like how the messages stays on your screen until you delete your message. For some reason Facebook is keep on crashing on me when I am on it for a long time. I am getting tired of keep on getting Facebook bands because of I am adding my friends on Facebook and then Facebook is saying I am adding people who I don't know andI am not adding people whoI don't know. I am keep on getting 30 day bands from adding people and I am getting tired of it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada

Ugh	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is whatever being honest this app does what it wants to when it wants hopefully that helps. Also usually when it acts weird if I remove it then download again it's fine.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The new update is kinda whack	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Everytime I open the app its so slow to load all the news feed. I have to restart the app and wait and eventually do the same thing again or wait for a long to load. Facebook, FIX IT NOW!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook is now perfect in my opinion! Good job guys!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Yet another update failure. PLEASE stop clogging the feed with sponsored pages! I've told it to hide them and they still show up. If they could remove the "sponsored apps" on the sidebar then I might give this two stars.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hate the new update everything on my feed is double posted and the app keeps crashing!!! I HATE IT! Have to use my FB through safari -.-	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I have a iPod 4g and the app is great to use instead of my computer but it constantly wants to time me out of the app it does it almost a total of 15 times a day enough to make me write this review about it so please fix this problem apple	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The updated version of the facebook app is a complete failure. I have to install and uninstall the app a lot of times but it didn't work. The app always crashes. I lost interest in using this app. Fail! If i can not put stars, I would do it. I was so sad. :(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love the new updated Facebook App.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Good app like the updates!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
You fail at having this app. It ALWAYS crashes and freezes up! It's made me not want a decent ok anymore due to how irritating it is to have to continuously go in and out of it	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This is very nice and good application to stay intouched with your community people and friends	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Stop all these updates like every week! Just have a big update instead of 20 of them in one month!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The new auto correct feature is rubbish, it tries to correct from the first letter typed and forces the correction if you continue typing:-). The app gets worse with each update! And you cannot revert to a previous version so avoid! Not content with forcing advertising into our feeds they now add features that are unnecessary and make the app too complex:-(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Kickass	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
the facebook app is always crashing freezing you post pictures or comments and alot of the time these posts dont appear and it is forever showing you in the wrong location facebook needs to get a grip and fix these problems	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I give it a four star for ease use. I do suggest you add the ability to rotate the phone for easier viewing and to make it easier to read some pages	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
But would be better if you could access others folder and if you could delete comments and posts. Oh and please don't listen to the few that want the dreaded hash tags!! Leave them on twitter where they belong!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Thanks for making networking fun!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
The app is confusing adding notifications that you have to search through every area to get rid of and where the hell do I go to find my friends list? Used to be in the left hand side bar but its gone now. Still not enchanted ...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
It follows your friends ok, but you cannot 'share' pictures, posts or friends' statuses ... Needs a 'share' button, and also a delete button to delete a comment if made in error!

Great app i use it everyday 5/5	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
When I first got the app it worked ok but with all these new features they slow it down and it is getting to where its signing me out sometimes when I crashes. Needs to get its crash bug fixed instead of adding more things that crash it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is junk almost every time i open it CRASH! Open post CRASH! Send message CRASH! It's just almost not worth using	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I always have my feed set to "Most Recent". But when I open the app each time it's all out of order. Get it together FB. Also another thing. Being able to disable feed from pages I "liked" is not accessible from the app. Get on that, thanks.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app is terribly slow. Always crashing and freezing when I'm browsing down my news feed or when I'm in messages. It's highly annoying, I've resulted in using Firefox app on my iPhone for Facebook.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Crashbook back at it again ! As soon as the app starts working decently. You try and develope something else dumb . That doesn't help the progress of the app. But it holds it back from all the other competition ... Which to me makes no sense at all! If there were another app to used if so get it . Even  if I had to pay for it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I hate the new news feed for mobiles.  I don't care about something that happened four days ago! Can't Facebook remember our preferences once clicked on "most recent"?? And too many adverts. Losing faith in Facebook all together....	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It's just ok because you keep making it slower.... I love FB just the app for IPhone is not good... I give 3 stars not for the FB site but for the App...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Extremely drains my battery life. The previous version was pretty good. That "update" suxx.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Awsum app.Basically buttery smooth..love it	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The latest update now allows me to see the pages/photo/statues that my friends like or have commented. I don't want to see that. This app is extremely slow. In all, this is the worse app I have ever downloaded.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love it! especially that with ever new update comes better features!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Facebook changes the lives of open, giving, ordinary folks. It has kept me in touch with family who is too far away, and what do you know?! I was invited to a very special graduation! I owe somebody a "thank you!" in a big way.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's ok and all but it's slow at updating and not fast enough for me to bring up	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

News feed is seriously annoying me now. Every time I open Facebook I have to change the newsfeed to recent. Sort it out. Why keep changing things when it was alright before?Slow!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Don't like the way when I want to post on someone's wall it now instantly goes to photos. If I wanted to post a photo I would go to photo not post. What's with that !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Gets better with every update! The current version allows for pretty much everything the PC version does. I've had no problems!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
After I update my apps it keeps my phone crashing!!!! I hate opening it now!!! Please make a quick action about this.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Pictures still seem to be an issue.  Opening often cause the app to freeze or crash.  It gets annoying as you have to kill if it freezes  and  in any case when you restart it you loose your place.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It crashes all the time. It freezes, or won't load. It isn't my service because my Instagram works perfectly fine when my fb app doesn't. Very disappointed.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Way to slow compared to instagram and is a really sketchy app all round	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Facebook app after update won't respond and then you have to shut it down	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes too frequently especially when opening pics. Downloaded 6.2 version twice still running old version very buggy app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Until Facebook quits censoring groups and people's opinions they don't agree with, I cannot endorse it in any way.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Before the latest update I would have rated higher, but now I am not getting all my newsfeed items & when I refresh or "update" my current newsfeed items double...then triple. Irritating...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Excellent!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes!! But I do like the new look	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I keep losing scores in my game apps like candy crash and my Facebook page is very slow loading, also I get a lot of spam	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
New version freezes and is non-responsive 45% of the time. Plus it closes and re-opens when it wants to.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook is getting boring :-(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Still needs some minor fixes, but love the newest version.I would like to be able to put the chat stickers in comments and status updates.Restoring the landscape view would be nice as well.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Ever since photo uploading has been enabled through the web browsers, I no longer have any use for this app - especially with the lag, crashes and missing chunks of time on the newsfeed. And at least with Safari or Chrome you can still access the desktop site, which is useful for more refined tasks like organizing photo albums.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
As soon as I did the update, I could not see anything. Had to delete app and downloaded it two times! It just keeps getting worst :/ it so bad that I am now using the site instead is the app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm loving everything about the app so far honestly I have nothing to complain about or mention that this needs to improve. Keep up the good work	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app keeps closing all the time!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Overall, I like the app. However, I would much prefer to be able to change my profile back to the old view rather than this timeline. We've had it for a while now and I still hate it. It looks very disorganized and I would prefer to have it how it used to be.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The update didn't do anything significant nor helpful. Pictures won't display at all.  Also, please find a way to collapse the chat bar. Thanks.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes all of the time. Only will post comments sometimes. Frustrating JUNK.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Has a lot of crashes and screen freezes several times a day. Drives me batty	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
There needs to he the same capability in the app as there is outside of it for being able to select for specific audiences when posting status updates. If I want to post a status update but hide it from only a few people, I can't unless I want to select for an entire group, which doesn't help in most cases. It would be great to add the option to hide a status from a select few people from the friends list. I'm surprised this hasn't even remotely been addressed yet, as this is one of the key features of Facebook.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is incredibly slow and not showing any pictures because it is "loading." Needs an update!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I oft times wonder why Facebook keeps booting me off! Gets really frustrating. Really wish you guys could fix all the glitches that keep cropping up.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
You fixed two of the three things I complained about!  Changing the cover pics and the ability to post to other's walls!  Third thing is to be able to change the friend settings where we choose the settings for individual friends; show in newsfeed, their updates, whether we want to see status updates, photos etc.  thanks!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
At first I thought it might be just my phone, but reading the other reviews I know that it's not. I have the same irritating issues. Having to openThe app just for it to close. Then re open it, then reopen it. And when I click on certain things it takes FOREVER to load. I'll be in the middle of a comment and the app just closes on me while I'm typing.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
After reading other comments I know realize it's not my phone it's facebook problem not mine. Thanks review for clearing this up.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I find Facebook getting better and easier just wish it didn't crash all the time when I'm messaging people other then that it's fast and easy to connect to the world and people who say its slow or lag it's ur provider and or devise ? Don't blame software for your hardware problem	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I enjoy using Facebook , could use a little less political stuff	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
For the most part this app does what I need it to do.  Does crash every now and then.  And I am not a fan of the annoying bubble message thing, but its not a huge deal.  I use it frequently so it can't be all that bad, right?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes all the time, is slow to update, hangs.A perfect example of how to break an app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Your fb app so stuck!!! Why??? Fix it plz...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I wish we could get the old FB back. I'm tired of seeing people on my feed that I don't know just because a friend commented on it. I never even see some of my friends post. Only the same ole people. Really not happy with it at all anymore and have considered more than once deleting my account.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Little steps to improve here and there, like improved tagging, but for every thing fixed something else is missing, unreliable or made worse. The floating button for a new message and having to drag it down the screen to close it? If you're bored and looking for things to do, there are plenty of features missing I'm sure we'd all love to have on our phones that we don't.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Would love to be able to ban group members, search group, edit documents and view others messages too please xxx also can you make it so I can see pending posts it's so annoying having to open safari every time I need to approve posts :(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
5-6 revisions now and STILL missing the ability to rotate the screen to get the landscape larger keyboard.The new message bubbles are also annoying, especially if you have the messenger app installed.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like it. But why can't I share anything to the page I administrate? I could do that before. Other that that, I like the update. But the "share" is a problem for me.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Very cool...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I will be deleting this app. It crashes all the time. Most recent view shows me posts for last week!!!?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why is this app so bad? There is ALWAYS SOMETHING jacked up here. Crashes all the time and VERY SLOW! I wish there was another social media app and if there was one I'd leave FB immediately!BOOOOOO Facebook!!!!!!!!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I do hate how the app will say I have 10 notification than I open the app and it's really only 2! That's annoying!!! It's freezing when you open pictures Again Annoying!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Got to continue to improve. All improvements make me more comfortable using FB.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I really enjoy Facebook, mostly the games cause it seems like that Facebook has been known to cause relationship problems....(Not FB's fault, just another way to lie and cheat), seems like with EVERY update it only gets worse. U have to open the app several times to get it to work. Maybe instead of adding more features u need to fix the problems, then add more things. Like now I will have notifications and have to reopen FB several times to actually see them. Fix the flaws please before adding anything more....!!!! Thanks	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I don't like timeline. And I can't delete comments on the iPad.  Also, It needs to be WebCam compatible like on the computer. Other than that, great app.I also love how it crashes frequently when I try to post pictures. -_-	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I can no longer access Facebook since the last update.  I arrive at my Facebook page and spin in "update land" forever.  It never updates; it just spins.  The app is now USELESS!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love love love being able to keep connected with family and friends.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
You don't need a new app every two months. Stop messing it up.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest update has made my chat not work I have to go into my messages and send from there... Very inconvenient!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
There is alot more you can do with the app (such as how you upload pics), rather than going online normally through your phone, but there is also some things you can't do on the app. You can't see people's bdays with the app and you can't get to your "other" folder for messages. And sometimes the app shuts down on its own or freezes up while searching for pages. You guys need to improve this app more. Thanks.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Since the last update - it doesn't load at all. Needs to be fixed!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app runs veeery slow. You've added mis-optimized features that makes my iPad 3 struggle in lagging. Also "bubbles" crash everytime. What is wrong with you?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I dont like it. Sometimes when i post, it doesnt show up on the news feed, only on my wall. The GIFT thing is absolutely dumb!! My friend purchased a gift for me in march, still havent gotten it. Also what happened to the option when we like a page, to be able to either show their post in our feed or get notified? I want to like more pages, but im a mom & dont want my kids to see it. Its only for 18& older.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Status updates are sometimes missing never to be seen only to be viewed on individuals walls. No consistency/continuity in wall posts,  slow & at times unresponsive, advertisements are annoying & unwanted. Facebook's privacy is questionable. Pictures are taking eons to load. The app is unstable. Getting seriously bored. I miss who they where and dislike who they now are.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This Facebook app has always had problems, but now it won't even open or load. I'd rather use the browser.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I do not know if this is scrabble or Facebook problem, but it will not connect on my iPhone it connects on my lg phone however,,	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Always on here and such a useful thing to have	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
App crashes multiple times before opening. Then runs and runs and runs to open a pic. Don't like my news feed having a limit to how far back it will let me see posting history. I do like some of the new features, but the loading time makes it hard to notice the good things. Also wish there was a way to get rid of the message bubble when done chatting with someone as it blocks my view.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest version update: Verdict?  App still shuts down randomly. Pretty consistently when viewing photos. ------UPDATE: Have to drop to 1 star due to the amount of times the app just quits. I now type in 1 sentence updates/comments. OR, I have to do a select all and copy just in case it quits on me so I can restore what I was typing. Fix that and I can evaluate the app with a logical state of mind versus emotional. -‰ÛÓ-UPDATE: I have more issues with the app quitting when viewing photos, posting photos. Quite annoying. ----Occasionally the app quits when trying to view a photo (actually, that is the only time it throws me back to home page). The comments...*sigh* for the love of everything that is holy, please just FIX the comments on posts. Missing comments, comments out of order, all of it. Just fix it. Is there no UAT for the fb app at all?!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Previous Review: I like everything except the fact that I can't share post & I can't @tag friends in my post & commentsThe above comment was from a few months ago. Now that I can share post & tag friends I love the app. I've always liked fb & this app just makes it easier to communicate with my fb friends & family.. LOVE IT!6/20/2013I like the latest app upgrade. Lots of new things to enjoy. But is there a reason why the developers will not make the app so that it goes into landscape mode?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I have always loved my FB app. However, the last several times I've updated to the more "up-to-date" version, it seems to get slower and slower. My news feed takes forever to reload. I can also forget searching for anything, or looking at a specific friend's page. I could be there forever waiting before that happens. Getting more and more disappointed with it as more time goes by. Also, when I pull up my friend list, the alphabetical option is gone from the side. If I want to browse, I have to start at the A's every time. It's rather annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook is a great app that enables you to connect with others,share thoughts and have a great time	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Don't get me wrong i love fb and have been using it for years now. But the most resent news feed does not work correctly since the update I still get news from yesturday in my feed for right now or from hours ago	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Hi I loved the app but now it keeps on crashing. I'd love to have the ability to do copy paste. But that would probably be too much.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It still takes forever to load. Sometimes it takes up to 4 minutes before the pics pull up so you can see your friends whole post. Please fix!!!!! We've been waiting awhile for this to be fixed.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I miss FaceBook's landscape support. Also, trying to view photos is just ridiculous. The photo takes forever to view, trying to view the whole photo is awkward because of the little information box that is there, and closing a photo requires about a ten second wait. I may opt for the browser app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it!!! No complaints!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes more often than not. Freezes, requires signing in and out, loading updates and uploads take too long	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is really good but sometimes when I view pictures it freezes and other times its very slow. The only part I don't like is if I want to delete comments I use ton able to just slide and delete, it won't happen now :/.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have problems from time to time. Trying to get someone to help is difficult. Sent emails etc with no reply. Haven't had anything major for awhile but it's ok.... It works when it works and when it doesn't well let's just say it gets boring :-(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Crashes often, screen freezes frequently, buttons tend not to work half the time. All new and added feature are pointless and only seem to slow the app down to the point it's almost useless.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love Facebook it's very entertaining	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I was asked to review Facebook. I was introduced to Facebook by my adolescent daughter years back. I enjoy the fact that I can reconnect with old real friends, and that I have made some new virtual world friends. I enjoy posting pictures, sharing items etc. however, I very much dislike getting notification saying that such and such has invited me to play slot mania, or any other annoying game, and when I click on that notification, I am taken to the App Store. That needs to be eliminated. That's an invasion of my privacy. I a, very careful about the pictures that I post, or the comments that I write. But, I do have serious concerns about my privacy on Facebook. I don't know who's controlling what, where, and when. In addition now if you want to play words with friends, scrabble or even Bookworm, you are asked to sign in through Facebook. I receive invitations to games from my friends, only to realize that it's the games that are inviting me, not my friends. Scary!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the most recent update to the Facebook (FB) app i have run into some frustrating issues. I have been trying to upload a couple of pics to my FB page (made 8 attempts) and i still have not been able to successfully upload them b/c it indicates that the connection to FB fails or times out each time i try.  When i try to view friends' pages or tap to view pics i run into either really long waits for pics to show up/refresh or the FB app suddenly closes down for no reason. Hoping FB will be fixing these issues very soon.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The Facebook app adopted some retarded new bugs, ever since the last 2 updates the app now takes at least 30 seconds to load and close out of pictures. The other issue is that whenever I get a new message and open up Facebook app again, it takes forever to load only to close out. Then takes forever to re-load the second time. I have 2 iPhones and its the same issues with the app on both	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I am giving this one star because I was able to download it and it did connect to my FB page. After that, it was downhill. The functions are so limited it's not worth using. In fact, I'm deleting it from my iPad. The updates do nothing to enhance the performance, and the bubble conversation is annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

No longer crashing all the time. Definitely a step up from the last three updates.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Facebook itself is a great social media site. The mobile app, however, leaves little to be desired. The postinga often do not mirror what is on the full site, specifically with regard to the news feed postings. Also, for some reason clicking on a picture to see it in full screen often causes a strange delay that makes it seem as if the app has frozen up. This is quite annoying to say the least. One day FB will spend more time and money on the app and make it much better.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It constantly crashes, really slow,  and it keeps un-liking all the pictures I liked!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook is like the funnest communicating app in the world	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
The new version is very slow, crashes ocasionaly and takes long time to be opened. However, since the chat heads update everything started moving like an iced piece of poo. Ruins the whole experience. It runs slow and crashes a lot on both my iPhone 4 and iPhone 5. I do not recommend installing this version, as a matter of fact do not install any update, it's just a constant headache.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Newly updated app takes forever to update when accessing it for first time. Never did that before... :-(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
- Too slow to upload and or update- No copy/paste capabilities - Privacy settings too limited- Should be able to "share" on selected "friends" only- Mark Zuckerberg should be killed	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't share everything yet and I wish I could post to private msg for some things but overall, a good mobile experience.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This latest version is utter rubbish. I can't get it to stay open for more than 20 seconds before it crashes. Wish I could go back a version until you sort this s*** out.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It's I'd glitchy, awful. Everytime an update comes up Facebook only gets worse.. Fix the glitches. And leave it alone!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like Facebook, but there are things I wish I could do from my phone that I can't. For example, if I want to upload pics to an album in a group- nope! Really? How hard can that be to put on the app?Don't care for the picture bubble that pops up when someone messages me. It gets in the way and is no better than the old notification on the top of the screen. Other than that it suits my needs.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Really good & easy to use!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
YulpSure do	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes allot and freezes very disappointed	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Bring back the ability to share things to other friends walls and to groups. It was changed where you could share in the app to groups and friends walls. Now it's back where you can only share to your wall. Bring back the ability to share to groups and friends walls.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I use it all the time, virtually no problems	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I love FB! It's great, but wish it was a little easier to upload multiple pix in an album on my iPad. The only "glitch" I have found.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It would be great to be able to do all the same things with the mobile/tablet that you can with a desktop computer. Like edit your own comments after posting and being able to view photo albums in groups/pages you have.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Lags, barely works, outdated, typical Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Amazing	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Pretty solid app. Two suggestions; 1) allow for cover photo repositioning by double-clicking and holding the photo you wanted moved. 2) when commenting or posting, if the user's finger slips off the box the box goes away. Most times the writing is left in the field to continue but not always. This app is otherwise very worthwhile.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Let me start off with me saying I enjoy facebook at times. It's great for connecting with old friends, new friends, or just a pastime. Not on iPhone. It's a piece of junk on the mobile platform. Not only does it have an amateur layout and interface, it's slow, it lags, and worst of all, don't even think about looking at picture albums, because as soon as you scroll through pictures; black screen, pause, crash, back to the home screen. No matter how many "updates" they give this thing, it'll always be better to go on the internet, even with safari.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Over all works decently. Crashes every now and again on my perfectly fine iPhone 5. Also it will jump my newsfeed from where I left it off for my most recent. It's got really stupid inconvenient glitches	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Add Tubitxhyboutique!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Yay, I love Facebook! I recently deactivated my account because of embarrassing myself so much but a week later reactived it. I'd highly recommend it to anyone in the age bracket.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Not bad for what it is, another social networking medium. Miss the features of typing a name and place to try and find people we've known. Wish I could find them all.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
BS!! Keeps crashing! Dammit!!! Also the app icon looks bad. It was better when it had the grid with silver.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok needs work.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The title says it all	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It told me it needed to update then it wouldn't update! So I removed it and tried to reinstall it and it won't install!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like Facebook for the most part, I don't go on a lot but I do, I don't complain.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Good applicati	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm writing a review purely so that the developers might sort out the fact it crashes and shuts down all the time. Mostly when I'm writing messages, it's awful. I don't know what you have changed to make it do this more frequently but please fix it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Needs the glitches sorted out but I'm still impressed	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Like another review said it's more like crashbook not Facebook. It freezes or just takes way too long to update. Plus you can't keep the news feed in most recent. I'm missing posts and the posts I see are all out if order. I like my news feed to be in chronological order.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It crashes sometimes when I upload very small images, and usually says its unable to send. Also, rarely, the chat heads don't work. I'll click on a conversation and nothing happens. Also it pretty frequently says my session timed out and makes me sign in again. The black tags for names are confusing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
They fixed the crashes and according to your Internet its very fast at loading!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Always crashing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love the updates, really upped their game. The bubbles for messages are cool. The layout works really well along with the gestures making it a beautifully smooth app to use with minimal crashing. Happy face booking!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Very useful. Please fix the following:I can't edit my albumI can't delete my post in my timelineI can't change or edit my picture caption.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
App much better , esp with the updated photo upload just a shame it crashes so much . Updates quicker through safari and sometimes takes so long to load I give up! Still needs some work	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

The mobile version of Facebook still lacks features that the desktop version has.  Specifically, we need SHARE!All versions of Facebook need a Dislike button!Fewer crashes lately, but it still crashes way too often!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
One thing I would request is the ability to delete or edit our status and comments. That's frustrating when you make mistake and have to go to laptop or computer to correct. Wish I could do on my phone	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Too many ads!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The new update ruined the app! It does not open at all. When you click on the app, it has a loading sign then crashes every single time. I have tried deleting and re-downloading over 10 times now, as well as updating my Software but nothing has worked. I have gone back to using Facebook on my computer because I can't even access from my phone with the new update. Facebook please fix this!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I do hate that it crashes. I also hate the talking bubbles. I just like the previous version better.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I access Facebook from my phone 99% of the time and find it extremely frustrating that I do not have access to all information on my page via my mobile device. Examples: when someone comments on a post, I would like to be able to read all comments, not just one or two that Facebook chooses. Additionally, I would like to view all of my email correspondences not just one I recently sent. Also, when I set preferences on my ap (such as: view most recent news rather than what Facebook has chosen or who I allow to see my posts), I would like it to keep those preferences until I change them (and not have to reset them periodically).	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Bravoooooo	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Possibly the worst app I've come across, I don't know what you've done in the last few updates but its getting worse and worse. Constantly crashes, full of sh1t adverts. Cripplingly slow. Basically a joke. Zuckerberg you obviously signed off on this garbage I suggested you put it where it belongs, in the trash!!!!Not even worth wasting your time on. Go to a pc or just use safari to view on an iPad instead. I wouldn't even give it a star only I can't leave a comment without doing so.Updated as of 23/06/2013Well done FaceArse it's still a steaming divot.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It's nice to have Facebook on the go but it crashes over and over again! It can crash at bad times, such as when creating an event meaning you can't get back to that exact location until you're at a computer later or you open the actual web page. They should stop adding stuff and iron out the insane amount of crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This Facebook app loves to crash too much. If you look at pictures for too long it crashes. I can't even add anything from my iPod touch without it crashing as just as I am tagging people. It is a wreck and needs to be fixed as soon as possible.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's ok just need some work. Every time I try to load the app, it crashes. Then some posts that I make never show up on the app but will on safari. The updates made Facebook worse.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Is really easy to post pics and comments on Facebook using this app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
You should really do something about this app because each time I try to open and see a picture it always crashes and then it crashes when I try opening it for the first time during the day 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Latest update is absolutely emptying my battery! This happens every time you send out an update, then I have to wait for a fix. How about testing your updates BEFORE sending them out?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Improve	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Honestly, there are no words to describe this terrible app. They've put more effort into making it look nice than actually making it work! What a piece of garbage, trash, the list can go on! If I could give it no stars, I would. They don't even read these review, otherwise, we wouldn't be putting this app down so much.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This latest update is crap, I can only see posts 12 hours old and can't open messages, don't bother facebookers	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Like the chatheads but please let me log out on my iPad! It just keeps me logged in, even after clicking logout, confirming, closing the app and shutting the iPad off. Go back in and start up the app again, there I am logged in. Arrrghhh!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	New Zealand
But after making the mistake of updating last update before checking it out first.  DO NOT UPDATE LATEST UPDATE. Bad move. Check it out first Facebook before giving us all grief.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
You're better off using your phone's browser!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The app is terrible.  Crashes and hangs up. Based on all the reviews I have seen. The recent "upgrade" is so terrible, I will not be on Facebook until the app is fixed.. Maybe this will get them to make the app functional.  So if the stockholders want to maintain my interest and potential dollars, then FIX it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's an ok app it gets me in Facebook but it runs slow ! And crashes alot and doesn't refresh and it never stays updated	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Great app for almost all aspects of Facebook.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Fed up with slow loading and update notifications for suggested apps. Freezes and crashes regularly so that's one thing I can count on not changing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Won't stop force closing after 10 seconds on my iPhone 4. Absolutely worthless app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

1) Arbitrarily crashes. 2) Sends the user back to the top of their feed for no reason at random times despite what the user desires. 3) If I have a choice between using a computer or the app, computer wins 100% of the time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
So addictive...I hate it...:)And there are some restrictions in the app...:(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada

Very good yes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It's Facebook cant go wrong with it the app is a wee bit slow but it's all good can live with that	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
SERIOUSLY?! Now I have to tell the app every time I refresh the feed to show me "most recent posts" instead of what Facebook thinks are most important to me?!!! Facebook, you're rushing yourself to an early obsolescence. It's always been a waste of time but now it's an annoying waste of time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Constantly crashes. When I post a pic or status from it it disappears. Shows up as content unavailable on regular FB page.  Seriously how hard is it to just have a mobile app that works???	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I was about to give it five stars until I downloaded the newest edition. It's very odd; extra unnecessary icons and such, and it orders friends weird when you look to view likes/comments (as oppose to listing them by time). Hopefully gets reverted soon.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The new version is cooler indeed. But it's just soooooo slow.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Yeah it's alright  I think we should be able to have the option to write our own relationship status though	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
The new version doesn't work on my iPhone at all!!! Terrible!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app has clearly been designed to maximise space used for advertising and wether or not it was a goal the app has suffered, the user interface is now slow and messy. The 'update' has made it worse and just confirmed that Facebook is not really for  the benefit of its users but its investors and is now more about advertising than a clean, fresh, app that I want to use. The chat bubble is pretty cool but I don't like how you can't minimise it easily. Very disappointed by Facebook, again. I think soon I will stop using it completely.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Talk about getting away with the bare minimum! The dev's are losers. Horrible. Need to connect with my PC or I only get 50% of the site. Dumb!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is great! On iPhone5 it never crashes it is fast and works great! If you app is crashing or not working maybe its you device or not enough wifi! I seriously wish mine crashed or was slow because I'm on it ALL the time!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Like Facebook on my PC, crashes far too much on my iPad.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This is a great app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
1- Way too much advertising!  2- Crashes and closes when clicking on links. 3- Why can I not edit on my iPad? I have to go to my laptop to edit!  4- I do like how the page displays so much better!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I hate this new version when people like your status you can see who liked it but  its not in order when you see it again -____ - i liked the past version better but there are better things i really liked id oike to see the likes in order and also when your friends send you picture its really slow to appear	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

It's a pretty damn good app however sometimes it randomly closes on its own :/	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
The app itself is ok, opens and closes fine and doesn't clog up the phone but every update makes it worse. It keeps switching to News Feed when I've specified Most Recent. Lags like hell and keeps saying I have notifications when I don't. All in all the app gets worse every day. Better stickin to Internet explorer	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Facebook & Cand crush are going to cost me my job. Mr. Zuckermann are you hiring for anything? Thanks in advance.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
When the app works? It's great. It needs to stop force closing.The random closing is annoying to say the least!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
FFS Facebook. I'm going to DOWNGRADE until you fix Newsfeed (YET AGAIN). FB Failing again.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The latest update did nothing to help, only to cause more frequent crashes.This app is a waste of your time, if you try, try, try again to upload a photo or change your status is creates crashes.This app is basically useless. For people wondering might as well get Twitter instead of wasting your time on Facebook.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It crashes almost daily and has glitches where it just shows the same stuff over and over I have to delete the app all the time and reload it just to get it to work	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slower than a snail and now INFESTED with unwanted ads. Possibly the most disappointing app I use.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I'm deleting the app and just using Safari for Facebook. This is just absolutely ridiculous. I'm getting so frustrated. This is probably the worst app I have used in a while. Get the crashing part fixed!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's good	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
The app doesn't load. It will be on my home screen and it stays blank white. Even though I am connected to wifi nothing loads up on profiles, home, friends or even messages	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
The update is faster, but I still can't share as easily or do other operations compared to the web site.  If I see someone that another has posted, there is no way for me to share it. And, i'm seeing a lot of "Person X likes -- photo," but not real postings. I think I am getting almost entirely advertising. I don't like that.I appreciate being able to do a direct share on the update.I think I've submitted this, but it keeps popping up when I try to write a review, which I'm frequently asked to do.New information-- the FB app crashes more often than any other I have.  Also, when using the app I want to be able to delete or hide certain postings and it seems that I can't do that.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Quit making changes and adding "fixes" that just make it slow, unresponsive, and repeatedly crash. Maybe you can restore the previous update. It was working great then...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Don't like when in middle of looking @ something and it just closes. Then have to open again.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

There's always something going wrong with this app, 90% garbage	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I think the Facebook app for iPhone needs improvement as it still crashes.  Also how come we get blocked from adding friends when u send a request but yet they don't tell u who reported they don't know u!?! I think we should have the right to know since I may have a lot of Facebook friends but I don't request them often so I think it would be helpful to know who said they don't know who u are.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

HmmScreen doesn't turn still Made reading easierWas a richer experienceDon't know if its because iPhone users are supposed too get a FB endorsed phone. The groups you set up like "local area" icon is nowhere to be found. So feeds of grouped users don't show up. Random reloading to the top when reopening app after using another. And scrolling back is mind numbing"It needs a previous screen button"Enlarging a pick to see the detail is way to delicate. Is somebody really going fix it?Age verification would be better than banning a site or user!Also offering a rating for filtering would be nice G,Pg, Pg13, R, XXX, Graphic Horror. Would be instep with the times. N letting viewers rate it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I always hesitate to download updates, but there was something I wanted in this one. I can no longer remember what could have been so compelling. All I've got now is an app that crashes every time I try to open it, so I have to open it 2 or 3 times before I can use it. Then it stops working again at random times. I like that I can scroll through multiple photos without having to leave my home page, but it still doesn't allow me to read the entirety of a long caption unless I go to my desktop. I have an iPhone 4, which I recently upgraded to the iOS 5.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I love Facebook mobile(as that is what I use) I would like for it to be a little faster and less lagging but other than that love the site.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's ridiculous how much Facebook crashes. I mostly message. And I use both Facebook and Facebook Messenger to do it. They both crash once every few seconds--with every message that I type.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Yup	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I love this app, love facebook my only issue is privacy settings! I want to be able to block the content of my page from people I have blocked and strangers! But it seems no matter what precautions I take I can't..... This needs to be rectified.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

SÌ¼per !!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Since the update its so slow loading and when you click on a photo it either freezes or takes forever loading, it's the worst and slowest update ever! You add things that we don't particularly want where it should be up the individual to set their home pages and sharing options of their choice not yours!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I don't like how I have to constantly hit most recent stories for it to do that.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Practically unusable. Won't load/refresh, still crashing, still sticking. Suggested posts appearing in my newsfeed that are obviously paid adverts. Rarely anything interesting. But somehow fb thinks it knows better than me what I want to see, so hides posts from friends, screws up the order things get posted in, and refreshing the feed leads to posts I just read disappearing altogether! Seriously, wtf?	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Awesome App, just crashes a lot. So I'm only giving it 3 out of 5 stars.  Need lots of work, because it crashes on certain pages.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

A lot of changes need to happen such as picture cropping, app crashing, I don't want to knowing about everybody else comments on Pictures Add featured turn off future comments(you can say) then this bother me what are you meaning by limiting my friend request if the person doesn't like me then they don't have to accepted my friend request, some of the games are ridiculous some ideas need more time to develop,the picture doubling problem, if it an official page of public figure let it be for real(I hate the run around). it's like you need to make another Facebook you bought Instagram and you don't know how long that will last . The privacy act mess up the image possibly persuade by your old university twins but you will never know (great story on your rise to glory) seriously finish your degree in business if your going to be a CEO you got all that money dude in the world I  would finish my business degree if I were in your shoes.

Really slow, force closes frequently, pages will not load, mostly doesn't allow you to tag someone in comments (try to partially type a friends name, their name should pop up and it usually doesn't), basically disappointing to use and overall frustrating.

Over 50MB for a Facebook app? Caches 20MB of data each time you update your news feed? Each update to this app makes it worse and worse. Hopefully someday soon they realize that!

Now I can Facebook anytime anywhere without being saddled to a laptop or PC.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
~("This Is my best social app so far'!")~my issue is that the app crashes sometimes.~("to much updates")	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Stop with the stupid updates all they do is change it and make it glitch just leave it alone and u wonder why it has such a low rating duh	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
App crashes if you get a little ways down on the newsfeed and the newsfeed doesn't show all recent stuff. Mine will show a few recent items then show posts from days ago that I've already seem numerous times.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
On it daily-depend on it to keep up w/my families & homies	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The new update has messed up my whole Facebook. I can't see recent statuses of anyone, I can't see my updated profile, I can't post picture and the list continues on. Fix it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes a lot of the time. Freezes when loading pages. Fix bugs	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Too slow	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
I like Facebook but you should not allow advertisements to be put on the site.  You should have people helping with problems and a phone number.  I am having trouble putting add friends under my picture.  You are not helping me do it.  Every time you up date Facebook I have more problems.  I can not remove page feed.Facebook goes down it crashes.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I have an iPhone 4, and this version crashes every other time I use it, and as usual after the 'update' it is running and loading much slower than before. Why not call it a 'slowdate' instead? Seems more appropriate than update, nothing went up. Asides from it running slow and crashing, yeah it's great.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Great!!!!!!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Annoying posting feature - arbitrarily decides to assign audience based on last group search, instead of using default audience.  No way to adjust this after post has been made.Difficulty bulk loading pics from iPad app.Overall, simply easier to use Windows version for everything but viewing.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
As we are aware there will be few issues in all softwares but this app gives me 99% availabilty and best performance either you in wifi or 4g.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It was better before update... Now it's confusing and my iPods really slow...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I use Facebook mostly on my iPhone. I do not like how it defaults to "News Feed" every time I go back on to the App. I want it to open on "Most Recent"!!!!!  News Feed shows me only what Facebook thinks is more important to me. Most Recent shows me what my friends are doing and what's important to me. Give me the choice of making the decision what I want.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I had lost track of most of my family and friends until I discovered Facebook. Thanks for giving me a way to reconnect with all this people I love as I get up in years.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like Facebook wish their could be more to do on it it be a lot better	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
FB app has been a pretty good ap. I like the chat feature, the bubbles that you can have up or make go away when you're talking to people. I don't like that it filters what you see: ie I dislike having to click on news feed, and most recent, and all friends. I like that it filters out game posts but there are still a lot of ads. And looking at all 3 sections, I still don't feel like I am seeing news from all my friends. I think they could improve by allowing all posts from all friends to come thru (not just the ones it "thinks" you want to see), having a separate tab for things you've "like'd"1	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's straightish	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Keep up with your friends and find long lost friends. Share pictures, emotions, and everything else.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The last 3 upgrades(?) have caused me to delete and reinstall this piece of junk just to get it to open again. Multiple 'hangs'. Locks up when updating "reading" status.  Junk!  iPhone 5. Have pretty much given up on this app on my phone. I want to enjoy reading about my friends, not get frustrated!  If I released buggy code like this crap, this many times in a row, I'd get fired. Massive FAIL	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Nice	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
L'application est malade en tant que telle, mais c'est deplaisant qu'elle se ferme des fois a l'occassion par elle meme perdant ainsi une conversation ou un commentaire en pleine redaction. Sinon c'est du solide comme tjrs facebook.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
All I want to do is see my newsfeed in chronological order but this app is too horrible. Sometimes it will let me see it in chronological order and sometimes it gives me feed from 2 days ago. Absolutely hate it!! Facebook please fix this ish because I'm sick and tired of this horrible app!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Poor, very poor. Works for a while, then once connected to a different wifi network/3G stops updating. Have to delete app and reinstall to get and updates.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Gracias facebook por todo, es lo mejor, muchas gracias por dejar que el mundo tenga una comunicasion con los demas desde muy lejos.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's a good app, I can talk to who I need to or upload photos etc.. But it has been crashing a lot in between messages and what not	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Just switched from Blackberry and this app is a big improvement over the BB app. I am not having any of the problems others are reporting - no crashes, photos load very quickly. The share options are great. It would be nice to have the landscape view available but that certainly is not a big deal since everything is very clear in portrait.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This app has some serious bug issues. Please, facebook staff, pay attention to these situations.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It takes FOREVER to load, and crashes too many times in a day! The pictures take forever to load, if at all! Just give us the old one back, and leave it alone!!!!!!Get rid of the 'top stories!' I shouldn't have to keep choosing 'most recent' after EVERY SINGLE TIME I post something!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The FB app is mostly annoying. It crashes frequently, only shows random posts, and when you post something, it automatically goes back to the top of the newsfeed, whether you had selected most recent or not.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Good App.  I wrote this so I would stop being asked too.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Birthday notifications dailyPost from other apps following privacy rules previously set.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Easy to navigate and has all the basic functions. Fairly easy to use but some features are left out. I do not like the fact that I cannot turn my iPhone sideways and type. I don't like the fact that I cannot dictate into some fields. I also did not see a place where it is easy to find out which of my friends birthdays are today.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I am loving this new fb.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
One of these days, they'll get it right. Upgrade is a dirty word when it comes to my Facebook app. It's not awful but it's not good.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I keep in touch with all my children and grand children on fb I get to see pics and videos of them write them on their wall and all without spending any extra money !! How can that be a bad thing ? I check it everyday and couldn't imagine life with out it :-) but I wish fb would fix the privacy issues	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love Facebook itself, but now it keeps sending so many commercial crap stuff, that it is hard to follow my friends!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I have been a user for about 4 years and have tremendously enjoyed the app ability and function that has enabled me to get in touch with friends, families and colleagues with whom I had lost contact over the last 40 years.But am not happy with the recent changes to the privacy contents and unwanted ads that are forced on to me.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

Liking it, no problems so far!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
STILL crashes when I view photos and timelines. Starting to get tired of it, other people have the same issue yet you continue to ignore us and put out other useless features. Pathetic excuse for a developmental team.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It has gotten better, but it is still painfully slow, even when connected to wifi. Crashes and freezes often, to the point I'm considering doing away with it. FB runs much better in Safari.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app keeps getting more and more intrusive while remaining minimally useful.  Notifications that you can add notifications! Tap here...crash. And FB privacy and security settings have become so complex it's hard to tell what is going on. Hate spam ie marketing!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

No way to get rid of it either!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Now that I have upgraded from an iPhone 1 8GB to an iPhone 4 16GB, the crashing has stopped.  However, I gave it four stars instead of five because I can't type sideways: I Want to type sideways with two thumbs and also view things "widescreen".	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Can we all just agree that this app needs SERIOUS help? If you are going to have a messenger app, take the messenger part out. Make it easier to delete a status. It's really not that hard to make a logical facebook app. Stop trying to make it look cool.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

You fail miserably as developers. You blatantly ignore users' pleas to retire landscape mode, you add 'features' that only slow the app down after you made it run faster in the first place, what is wrong with you?	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It also would be better if I didn't have to load the photo on my news feed. I am using a 4th generation iPod and I think it is unfair for this app to only fully work on a 5th generation.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Another update, still no fix for the 'Most Recent' news feed option.The lack of an option to set 'Most Recent' as the default news feed option is incredibly frustrating. Why the app designers have set it to show me the same week old stories when it starts up and then go through a series of lags and hangs in order to view the most recent stories is beyond me. The app is no longer user friendly and it's quicker to log on through the web browser thus defeating the purpose of having a stand alone app.I hope the developers restore the option to choose a default view as this (along with some other tweaks like reducing the text size of comment links etc) has made the app a slow and unenjoyable experience.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

As best I could tell, the last updated version didn't allow you to turn off the chat feature. As a person who's not a big fan of online chatting, I had found this pretty frustrating and was on the verge of deleting the app. So I was happy to download today's updated version and discover that it once again allows you to turn off chat -- just go to the top right of the chat window, click on the top, and a "turn off chat" option will appear. Glad for the update.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Better! Several bugs have been fixed with this release (6.2) including the bug that caused the UI to be inconsistent on my iPhone 4S. Still a bit finicky at times and not as powerful as the web interface, but it's a lot better than it was.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I have to open and re open and then re re open just to actually use the app, then, if you are trying to view a picture or read a post in further detail, nope the Crashbook app crashes, the bubble message thing is stupid, and I just use the safari browser now to check Facebook.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update made it where I can't post any statuses. It fails every time. I just want to post on Facebook without any hassle.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Update didn't fix the crashes. Still crashes two times when starting.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
pretty cool	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	New Zealand
Used to be good. Now timeline out of order. Comments out of time order so it looks like someone answered before you asked. Cannot see albums of photos on liked pages which for some pages is the whole point. If a pages has thousands of photos you don't want to be looking through a mixture. Completely rubbish and for me a waste of time. Back to the pc as mobile just not good enough so much for mobile technology. You would think with all the money Facebook have that they would fully test stuff before launching it to market.New update hasn't fixed the photo issue just made it worse. So now you can't see the albums you don't even if access to the photos. I'm an artist and use pages to show my work so off. so off to some place else  no point in facebook if people can't see my work.New update 18th June. Said it fixed bugs but hasn't all the same. Completely pointless.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Awesome	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app on iPad , so portable and so convienant to keep in touch with family and friends!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Nice	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
You should make it be able go into landscape when you turn it	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
So slow! It won't even load the news feed or my own timeline! At first i tough it was my provider internet but i can load the mobile page from safari fine!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps crashing even though the update game out	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Crashes every time I open it, at least once. I can never browse my photos because it either loads slower than a sloth or crashes when it gets overwhelmed. How many complaints till it is fixed? Stop adding features and make it accessible. I thought the update would fix this, but clearly choosing who can view your shared stuff is of upmost importance. Slow clap Facebook.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Absolute Garbage.. Ever heard the expression.. IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT! New notification bar at the bottom is horrendous.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
New update crashes the app as soon as I download it.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Still can't see "posts from others" on pages, come on fb some of us don't have access to a desktop and you have removed an integral part of using these pages.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Updated it just know, icon disappeared, try to reinstall, but App Store maintains its still on my iPad....	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Birthdays should be shown at the top like in the web version.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The new update is rubbish! Do not update!! My time line now doesn't load at all!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Could you please change to 'Most Recent' option for the News Feed. It never seems to work properly.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
I thought that this update will have the hashtag option :/ more than a update with new things we need a performance update	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Can we please get a Facebook app icon change. It just looks to plan. The same old icon just gets old.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Birthdays should be shown on the newsfeed at the top like the web version.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great update to the bugs found in version 6.1. The app is now fully functional and more importantly, usable. "Animation" sequences (opening chat heads, photos, etc) no longer takes eons.In all, an awesome fix. Version 6.2 is no longer a RAM hog. Still hoping to be able to delete comments/posts within the app one day! :P	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
That update made everything Worse it won't load pictures profile pictures and just in general won't load	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still unable to read 'posts by others' on pages on any device.  This has been so for months now - why are we prevented from reading what others have written and are forced to just be able to read the highlights page?  Also not seeing everything on my timeline, just compared iPhone to PC screen and loads of posts are missing from iPhone - I use my phone when travelling and need to see ALL posts.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Not loading	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Like the previous version, only slower and less responsive. Great.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Coooool	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Wth FB?!! I can't stay on for 30 seconds without it crashing!!! Even after updating the latest software!!! This is FRUSTRATING!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Well, it was just getting their. Now taken a nose dive in the slow lane!  Icons, emotions and other stuff.   Just make it faster!  Job done!That's all otherwise	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Why did you decide to revert back to the older design language of early iOS apps? Dumb. Please revert back to the new, swipe to reveal an underlying panel-style UI ASAP. This is a step back.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Really great app but I think it would be 100000000X better if we were able to save videos to our phones!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Would be 5 stars if we could see posts by " others " on liked pages.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
UNUSABLEThe previous update was so bad I couldn't use the app except to look at notifications. Just updated it now and IT'S EVEN WORSE!!This is ridiculous. FIX THE THING ALREADY!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Okay so my app always crashes, It takes me clicking on the app like 20 times before it opens finally. ALSOI can't go offline anymore! Like WTF why can't I show myself  as offline anymore. There are so many bugs and glitches! Not worth downloading Honest to god	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Downloaded update on 18/6 and app will not open. Exact same as previous version. Need to sort out these bugs	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Very crucial feature on the desktop site.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Im not yet able to do this. I can only choose 'public', 'only me' or 'friends'. I have to go into safari to update it and id rather not. Pls can u add the functionality to the app. Thanks	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Clicking on the person icon doesn't open to allow me to type a message what is up?	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
The update download is slowwww.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Here's an idea - quit adding "cool new features" and fix the MANY problems listed in these reviews first. Thanks.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps switching me from Most Recent to Newsfeed	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes at least once when I try to open it and it's 50:50 whether I'll be able to read any of the comments on posts	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Run better than previous version. This update looks better. Get it!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Fast, reliable & A familiar interface. I only wish I could change my timelines cover photo from the app. Other than that 1 flaw the app is A good way to use face books services with out my computer. Great job guys :-) great job on the update as well. It's more stable a fluid now. Thanx:-)	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
All things considered, this app is OK.  It does what you need to keep updated.  Couldn't ask for much more.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Ughhh	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I would love to update 'where do you live' with my real city and state and not be limited by your pull down list.  I have requested that you add my city to your list about 8 times in the past two years.  If you can't list every city then give people the option to write it in.  Thanks.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The only problem I don't like is that, you can't access the settings to allow or to not allow people to see some of your 'about' category such as, the relationship status.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes all the time!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
An update and still no landscape !!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Thank for update!!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
As title. Listen to your customers.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Bad	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I really don't have a problem with the app, maybe that it closes on me sometimes but that's it. I'm not a lazy person so I just open it back up! :-)	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I wish there a landscape orientation for the iPhone so pretty good for the iPad pretty good, for the iPhone....not so much.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I can't even open Facebook now!! It continually tries to load but nothing ever does!!!! Rubbish!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Much better than other updates. Love the new buttons on the bottom much easier. Wish it didnt have bugs like showing wrong notifications or crashing and that it was faster...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
For all they earn, they make a shitty app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I don't care what anyone says, I love the new Facebook updates!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Love it!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
i cant copy paste  and cant even save pictures please kindly do something on copy paste status thingy please	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
This used to be a really good app before Facebook decided it was desirable to churn out endless, repetitive and irrelevant advertisements up to every third post. They're unblockable (hiding just means they come back out later), unreportable (spam reporting is ignored since FB gets paid to insert them into your timeline) and make the app completely unusable. I'm only giving it even one star because I can't select a negative number. Avoid at all costs.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Quite rubbish tbf	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Can't even reply to messages without it shutting off its getting worse	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I like the app and when I updated it, my fb keeps crashing ! Needs o be fixed !!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I've had other smartphones.....why can't you share things off of facebook via multimedia from an iPhone ???? Other phones let me share things via email, on Facebook and in. A text/multimedia message. Can y'all check this out? Right now, I have to save pics, etc. to my camera and then leave Facebook, and then send thru my camera roll.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Closes down constantly. Makes using it practically impossible now. So irritating and annoying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
My brand new ipad 4 won't load with the latest version of facebook-if it temporarily does it gets stuck and I can't get any status updates on facebook.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
This new update is pretty good so far.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Uploading photos to Facebook thru any browser is just a no go, so I decided to check out this app... so many new and bad reviews for this version, but I was like, "well, I can always delete it."It works great for me on this (gen 1) iPad.  I've had other versions of this app before and wound up deleting them, but for now this one is a keeper! I wonder how many poor reviews are from people with either an iPhone (or perhaps even a newer generation of iPad?  I'd give it a try and see if it works for you... takes more time to write a bad review than it does to delete a crappy app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Stick to ONE format and add features to it. Once we get used to a "new" format, you guys change it up AGAIN.STOP!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The New Updates Is Wonderful	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It pretty much always works as I want it to, except when I'm relying on my 3G cellular network. But at home it almost always does what I want it to. I do wish I could copy and paste again! But I love being able to tag people from my mobile device.I do not like seeing 48 notifications on my home screen, but when I open the app there is only 3. It is irritating! I have slight OCD and I don't like the red numbers always up on my home screen. Love the "feeling‰Û_" addition to this update!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Ok I have two iOS systems my phone and my iPod touch Gen2, opening this up on my phone is fine but I'm constantly having issues opening Facebook on my iPod. You seriously need to fix that for ALL iOS systems not just the current ones	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
As of the latest update I am unable to log on using the iPhone. You guts move 2 steps forward and 3 back!! Just great 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I enjoy the updates on fb thing. I like it. Some people like the reg fb  instead of timeline.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
What's the point of an update that makes it worse freezes even more crashes and resets its self every time you look at pictures for Christ sake get it fixed!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Please fix this. It closes all the time. It's really annoying. I was really happy when I saw an update but this is just as horrible as the last version.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Great app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's Facebook but I which I could turn it sideways give me landscape mode!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I like that it works sometimes it does take a while to sync but it does what it does nothing head turning. I use it on my I phone 5	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Muy buena aplicacion la mejor del mundo yo diria la AMO	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This update slows down the app. It takes forever to open...fix it NOW!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app keeps closing randomly	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I hate this update.  The newsfeed is all over the place	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love the new mobile messaging. Makes it way easier. Can't wait for Facebook Home for other phones. But I hate that I have to keep reopening the app over and over again. It's getting really annoying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I love lots of the new features since my last mobile upgrade. Glad to be able to save pics to my phone again.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I enjoy every little thing about FB for my iPhone	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I hate this new upgrade. Every time in using the app this annoying message comes on asking if I want notifications. NO! Would give it 0 starts if I could.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't even tell you how many times my Facebook app has crashed since the new update. It's ridiculous.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
All these updates you have for this app yet you still haven't made it landscape applicable.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I kinda like it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Overall great FB app- only downside, it freezes up @ least 1-2Xs Daily :/Some times it kicks me off entirely	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashes almost every two minuets	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Keeps closing ALL THE TIME. When I'm typing or messaging someone it keeps closing and losing all that I typed. It's becoming very frustrating.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I love Facebook I have friends and family that I haven't seen in years that I keep in touch with :)	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Ups and downs but now I really like all the changes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's hard to find a app that actually gets better with every update! But this app does work better and shows improvement every time!! Facebook has been listening to its users and I love it!! Keep doing what your doing people!! And for the people complaining, get over it they can't meet everyone's needs at the same time! Stop being spoiled!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Stop updating 3 and 4 times a month. Get it right and stop it for real. How ever this is a delightful waste of time and waaaay better that most other social networks.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Won't even let me ask friend request to people I don't know...Oh like thats not going on...get real!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Always something with Facebook but its a good app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love this app but hate that it takes me 3 attempts at opening it to use it. So many crashes now! I like the new additions but fix the bugs already!!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Not reliable enough to be called facebook	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
now it doesnt even show up on my screen and i cant get into the app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Big thumbs down. This app is completely pointless. I only see posts from the same five people every day -- about 1% of the posts I see when I log in via web browser. Complete waste of time.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why cant i hide post from friends without unfriend them? I cant delete post and its very diff the app from the computer.... Hate all those comercial spots!!...FB u r losing me!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
As a small business worker, it's tough to get advertisement out there. We started a Facebook page and have 120+ likes, but only a few people are seeing our post regularly because we don't pay the fee. I really don't like that.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
What was a reasonable app (with some issues) has turned into a very unreasonable app with lots of issues!! Now slower, confusing hard to find buttons. Let's go back to previous version.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Good updates, fluid operation.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Not to impressed with the last update.  I have activity sent to Most recent but when I share a picture or post it takes my activity to news feed. Or when I share a picture or quote, I have to scroll all the way back down to where I was instead of continuing after sharing.  Plz fix!! Very annoying  on Iphone5	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Don't update to the latest version it doesn work yet again Facebook why do you bother trying to fix something that isn't broken try learning by your mistakes for once	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Luv it!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
STILL no sound or vibration when notifications pop up after TEN months. Also, the app still crashes. Mostly when trying to open a photo on a Page. This is on mine and my wifes iPhone 5's, and was on my iPhone 4 as well. The new version has removed the alphabetic letters from the side of the friends list which makes it harder to get to the friend you want, and the news feed always reverts to Top Stories instead of leaving it on Most Recent or whatever people wants it on.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Great app but you need to take that bubble off in your next update its dreadful?!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Pretty good but crashes WAY too much!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It is worse after update! Seriously!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Much easier and love that I now get my private messages instantly instead of 8 days later!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Poorly designed, quite buggy. How about you guys stop experimenting?!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I find it irritating that you cannot edit or delete a status from the app. Group functionality is also lacking. App is ok if you just want to scroll though other people's statuses.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Dont update. Terrible.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The new Update of Facebook is great. There's no trouble. I like it. I have a Facebook.!! It's sometime work. But it's okay check out ARCADE CLAW APP..!!! Please	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I've done everything from killing the app, restarting my iPod, and redownloading the app and ALL IT EVER DOES IS CRASH. FIX IT!!!! Whether I'm trying to upload pictures or view a friends timeline or even my own, all it does is crash. And I hate the stupid bubble thing that pops up for messages. It's annoying and gets in the way and makes the app crash even more than it already does.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App closes it self	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Facebook is much better then it use to be.  But, today, I was looking for an add for an ad that I saw on my timeline a week ago.  I couldn't find the add even after scrolling down as far as I could.  There was no way to search for that posting. If that could be changed, it would make FB better.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Mine sometimes crashes on iPhone five and just closes the app down then I have to click it again and I loose the page I'm on. And when I look at pictures, the edges are missing and I have to zoom out to see the whole picture. Other then that I do like it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

Whenever I try to post pictures from my iPod touch 4th gen it always crashes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Developers need to make it possible for Facebook apps for mobile and tablet devices to to all things one can do on a PC, since far more people are using mobile and tablet devices... Slow to update, updates missing for friends, app crashes, the list goes on and on!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just wished it would put all the current post on top. It's to scattered. Just don't keep changing all the time	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This application is not comparable to the mobile version. The mobile version has more capabilities and options then this app. For example, the app freezes and you cannot view your archived messages. Also you cannot unfollow someone's post after receiving several notifications.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Please read the daily comments written under the sections when we use new functions ! Some of them doesn't work yet complicated best function will be cut and paste for the status section so we can use on the translate on phone App if its in other language! Same as we do it on the computer ! Current version is the worst !!! It's keep crashing and cut and paste option doesn't work so the share option for others post is mostly broken too !!! Still nothing is fixed !! All my comments are deleting it self and had to be written again !! It's the comments we put under others post that is!!! New version is not improved either!I never though I would but if not fixed I will cancel my account !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

The latest update to the app seems to have crashed the ability of the news feed to update.  It works fine over the web, but I can't use the app any longer.  Avoid.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever since the last update my Facebook app for iphone 5 doesn't work at all anymore. Constantly says updating but never does!  I've deleted and reinstalled numerous times only for the same result!  Please fix this issue!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This is single handedly the worst app ever made. Soooo slow at everything! I just log in through safari now.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I cant stand the fact that I always have to hit the ‰ÛÏall friends‰Û button just to see the recent status. Please fix it. I would love this app so much more if they would just fix that. Thank you.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

This app crashes more than a crash test dummy. Hello, prior to the recent updates it didn't. Did the NSA suggest this too???	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still haven't fixed the bug where the app closes spontaneously all the time (usually just as I'm about to press send in chat).	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Can't use app at all after updating. Get a "Session expired" error. Have deleted and re-installed 3 times. Still get the error. Ridiculous that the largest social networking platform puts out such a poor quality app. Testers, anyone???	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ever since I updated it states updating and doesn't ever update it crashes . What is up with this app I just go onto safari to use facebook. It's actually very annoying and frustrating plus its kinda sad such a big social media page an can't have more than a 2 1/2 star rating fix all the bugs and it might get better reviews .	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Used to work fine.  Updated and then seems to love to just hang.  Pages take 20-30 seconds to load.  Every once and a while the app will crash just to keep it interesting.  It is simpler for me to just get on FB using Safari.  Pain, but it actually works	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Facebook has been running very slow and freezing up it keeps kicking me off and sometimes it takes a few times of going to the app for it to open please fix this!!! :-(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Seems like it fails more, with every update. Viewing news feed by newest first is so broken, and puts a few in order but the rest is mixed up. I'm seeing stuff from previous day, after posts from 1~2 hours ago. I don't understand how a web version that runs through a browser can still be more superior to a actual app designed for the soul purpose of doing all things Facebook.As always, Ads are annoying the s*** out of me too.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
QUIT  PRETENDING TO FIX THIS JUNK, all you ever do is make it worse, time for an uninstall and go back to the archaic way of going on the Internet	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This review is only for the developers really....when you swipe to the left you have the names of all your friends Facebook tells you if they are online or not but when it has the mobile icon with 1m next to it and you open a chat to "John Appleseed" it says they are online at the top (in one place it says they have just come offline and on the other try are still active) hope this review helps. Great app, use it all the time. Also if like to add when I post a status a ghost status appears before the actual one I can only see the ghost one though.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Anytime you read an article that someone posts, it crashes. If you try and look at any posts from earlier in the day, it crashes. It also skips 8-9 hours of posts from the "Most Recent" part of the news feed. I am constantly frustrated using this app. It has only gotten worse with too many bells and whistles that slow it down.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I'd have to say this is one of the most frustrating apps I have ever used! It's definitely crashbook!!!! It crashes frequently and the app is true slow. It's not my phone either. I at times have to use safari just to get something done on my Facebook so I know right then and there its the app!!! Come on mark z u created FB from a dorm room do something better with the app please and thank u very much!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Wow. I can't believe that FB just automatically wrote a review on here when I first logged into write one myself. Which I was going to leave 5 stars since I haven't ever had any problems with FB crashing or anything but after that -1 star. :(  Still NO problems with it though.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
If you are using the 4 inch retina on the iPhone 5 than you will come across this issue. When ever you view a photo that is in a different aspect ratio, it is automatically zoomed in. When you try to zoom out so you can see the entire image, it is obscured by the bar at the top and the text below. You tap once for it to go away, and it does but the photo resizes and you can't see all of the photo once again. There is no way around it, and its frustrating.On the larger retina, images should not be expanded to fit the top and the bottom. It should be sized to fit the sides. Taping once should only hide the interface and text, not resize the image as well. It's incredibly annoying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I love it! It's simple & quick to stay in touch & I love the ease to upload my precious pix	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Have no problems with this app. Works great.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Generally speaking this is a good app. But it could be a lot better. The biggest problem I have is sometimes the app freezes for about 30 seconds or just completely crashes out if I try and look at pictures. There are a few other little inconveniences such as no being able to change your cover photo (as far as I am aware) and as you can't do it on safari/chrome on iPad you have to use a computer to change it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Although the application is ok, the newer versions have been ever so slow to load or view anything on it. The original version was the best as it was faster to navigate!! Way too many crashes!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

iPhone 5They've improved it a bit but you still can't edit captions or anything you post once you post it. Also, sometimes you can't scroll a zoomed-in picture. Furthermore, it still crashes here and there and the notifications are almost always wrong! It tells me I have "x" amount but when I log in, it's a different amount.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The issues with this app are too numerous to list all but here is a brief overview: crashes frequently while loading, freezes more than it scrolls, can take 5-10 minutes to load no matter what reception or Internet access is, 9 times out of 10 the most recent updates will be 8 hours or more old, status updates do not post, privacy settings change on their own....that is just a start. I rarely use it anymore since it is essentially not functional.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am happy with FB! I sometimes have issues with loading photos, but like all other technology there will be a malfunction every now and then. Keep evolving FACEBOOK!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I am glad there is a Facebook app an it is easy to use. What I need for it to provide is a list of birthdays daily without having to find them. It does crash a lot, and I also don't like that I have to keep changing the news feed to Most Recent as it defaults to people that just post a lot, many of which I don't care about.  I also wish I had a way to easy search for my friends by a particular city of state when I am visiting there.

This is my third time deleting and reinstalling this app because it just doesn't open. When it does open, it only opens to something on my newsfeed from weeks ago and "loads" forever. And no- it isn't my Internet, it's this dumb app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I like reading my friends posts. I don't like: choosing most recent (and having to re-choose most recent daily) and getting posts from two days ago before 30 minutes ago (?!?), being asked daily if I want updates sent to my phone (I turned that feature off for a reason), and constantly have my feed inundated with 'recommended pages'. If all that cow excrement were to be fixed, I'd rate the app 4-5 stars, maybe. However, whoever is in charge has proven that as they 'fix' one problem, they create four or five more irritating problems. ;(	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It will not refresh the newsfeed on my iPhone 4s.  It keeps loading but doesn't change.  You have to completely close out of the app and log back in to get it to show anything recent.  I'm going back to MySpace!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I haven't been able to get on my Facebook app for several days because it just doesn't upload at all. The most recent post showing up on my newsfeed is from 2 days ago. Even my own profile page won't load. I have tried uninstalling and re-installing but that doesn't work either. There is just way too much going on on the Facebook app. I just want status updates and pictures. Everything else is fluff that is not needed. I much prefer Instagram now and I am contemplating getting rid of Facebook altogether. It has become so complicated and busy, it's lost the whole reason Facebook was created in the first place: to connect with people via pictures and statuses. The new message bubble is the worst thing Facebook has done yet. It's pointless, hard to use, and just plain frustrating. Go back to the basics, Facebook.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

No. Facebook is constantly crashing on me.

Usually facebook app works amazing! But recently  on ipod,ipad,and iphone the messenger part of it doesnt work!

I enjoy Facebook to connect with old and new friends. But I do not like the bashing that goes on from time to time.  I wish we can keep more private as well. TMI sometimes!

Latest update still crashes a bit...especially when trying to view my NewsFeed in chronological order, especially since I have to reset that display EVERY SINGLE TIME. I've disabled the annoying bubbles, so that is not as much of an issue.First, you took away the landscape orientation (hate the portrait) and, now, it's very challenging to see my newsfeed in order. I don't care what OTHER people think is important. It's usually hours btwn logins..I want to see threads develop. Please fix. Thanks.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The app crashes at least once every time open it. The pics load so slowly I sometimes decide to just wait until I'm on my computer to look at them. The newsfeed and most recent news never load all the way so there is a zigzag line between a post 2 hours ago and a post made last night at 11pm. Please update and fix everything because it's getting so frustrating for all of us!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So many updates, only to continuously fail. -_-	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This version is definitely better, but still not fully functional like my laptop!If it weren't for my iPad's ease of use and portability, I wouldn't chose to open Facebook using it!You can do better!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I hate that the Apple/iTunes App Store almost forces updates. That being said, the current FB app update would not load after 4 days. Subsequently, after reading the reviews pertaining to the update, I simply choose to delete the app altogether. Why waste time forcing an unnecessary, bug infested version, especially after fair warning. No thanks! Let me know when the issues have been resolved.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This sh*t always kicks me out of the app, and it's terrible,  I'm sorry but you need to fix this asap! I'm tired of deleting it and re-installing it...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The Facebook app is amazing I giv it five stars.he truly thought of everything that could possibly be on a social network.thank you mark .	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Overall the job gets done but the app doesn't allow full functions of FB and tends to not show a lot of status updates. And u can't tag from IOS.. Freezes a lot and can't do enough settings on app	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
FIX THE CONSTANT CRASHING! That's all it does is crash. I have to open it 45 times before it works. I go to look at pictures or continue reading a post it crashes.

It used to be that I had to tell the app I wanted to view my news feed in "most recent" ordering every time I opened the app. Now the feature appears to be completely broken. Who knows how many items I ACTUALLY care about I am missing. Also, it seems I can no longer categorically ban updates from specific games and apps my friends are using from showing up in my feed. I don't care that someone farted in Candy Squish Bonanza.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't open my chats again. I will click the chat button and the list will come up but when I click a name it won't show up. The old chat was fine and worked perfectly, it didn't need to be changed.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I've skipped the "update your information" sections probably 15 times thus far but it keeps showing up. Why in God's name would anyone be stupid enough to actually list their address, phone number , or any other private information like that if it weren't a business? Please stop asking.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app is great!! I love Facebook that's basically all I do is go on Facebook and I hate going on Facebook on the computer. It's just such a piss off to be honest. It's so much easier on the phone and it's faster. Great job!!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

I love my Facebook and keeping it touch with everyone, as well as the powerful marketing tool it is! But why is this app so huge? And why, after a gazillion updates, does it still constantly crash? And last but not least, why must there be a separate app if you want to use your business pages from your mobile device? So then we have to have two crashing, space hog apps on our device!? Ugh!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app continues to lack the functionality if the browser version of Facebook.  I also am getting very tired of the intrusive ads the are evermore prevalent in the feeds.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I feeling like writing this review is basically taking away productivity of my FB usage. :)PLEASE MAKE LANDSCAPE MODE AVAILABLE. This is ridiculous having to type using tiny keys and it would make pictures and postings easier to view and read.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

The current version is terrible! I dont receive notifications anymore. When i do, they are hours later and i receive them all at one time. But i can only view them in notifications, not on my timeline. Also keeps reposting my check-ins from months ago.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok i understand that crashing and freazing happens due to the large amount of data used, but when it crashes loading a picture we are going to have a problem. And i dont like how they disabled changing the keyboard from portrait to landscape.Honestly this is barely better than trying to run it in apple's craptacular mobile browserRevision on last review: i think the product has in fact gotten worse! Ok so the crashes have gotten more frequent, its taking up more memory with each update! the connection is very slow and pathetic how is it taking seconds to load a picture even on a high end connection! If it were not for the fact i like to keep in touch with friends i would delete this app!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Every other update seems stable. This one is working fine, with minimal crashes. Last version was a nightmare.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
After update it freezes and crashes constantly. Sometimes it crashes before it even opens. "Most recent" is often not in reverse chronological order and I still can't view in landscape. So frustrating I usually skip it and just use Twitter.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Between trying to load a friends' page to trying to open a shared link, this App will anger you more than anything else. You're better off using Safari!And don't let updates fool you; they make everything worse. When I started, the app had a lot of loading problems, but nothing awful. Now, the only thing that will load is my news feed, which shows multiples of the same update and likes to refresh itself when I'm mid sentence.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest version for iPhone has been a terrible one.  It endlessly asks if I want to synch FB to my iPhone and for whatever reasoning, selecting not to synch means endless harassment until I give in and comply from the looks of it. Furthering my frustration is when I attempt to check recent activity on a "status update" FB now has an option to synch by "clicking here to learn more" (or similar wording).	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Luv faceBook but I get irritated when I post things and mysteriously they disappear. I ask people to read or look something I've posted and its gone. What? I can't access my games because Facebook denies me access to games I've been playing or months. Every time I try to access rewards (on some games) I have to register again, and again. What is it? What I posted this morning is gone already. But there are posts from yesterday popping up. Help!  I getting fed up.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The Facebook app has everything it needs to be a good app, a nice interface, (with a few minor exceptions) good IMing, and obviously, the app does get the job done. ...if it starts. In order to get the stupid app to start, I have to go through starting the app a couple of times to immediately crash. Then it works, albeit slowly. Also, whenever I open up a photo in full view, sometimes I can go into the next photo, but sometimes, I can't. Overall, 2/5 for annoying bugs. If they were all fixed, I'd give this a 4/5.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I used to lovethis app even better than actually going on my laptop because i only like most recent not top stories and te app would remember my preferences so that i didnt have tochoose it each and every time i wanted to scroll thru my wall. Now each time i go onto it i have to choose most recent and so much of the time it says none available when its been 8 hrs or the most recent are fromthen and no amount of reloading helps fix it. And when you FINALLY et it to work right then after you scroll about ten pages down to start looking at what youve missed, eqch time you click on anything i mean anything even just a pic to blow it up it starts all over with nothing! And you have to start over trying to manipulate itto show you most recent instead of top news and scroll down again to the point where you left off! The messenger on the program and the separate messenger both get in the way too and if you have bothyou cant even use the regular app to answer messeges without the same thin happening! Every time it says i needto update this thing i dont want to because the only thing that gets changed is the stuff that does work doesnt anymore and the thingsthat didnt work are more aggravating!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Slow to load even with wi-fi and crashes a lot. Thought the update would improve it, but no such luck. "Most recent" includes posts from two minutes ago as well as 24-hours ago - posts are all out of order. Fix the actual functionality of the app before adding more features or "improvements". Nothing more frustrating than an app that doesn't work - it's faster to just use Chrome and login to FB. IPhone 4s	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I like staying in touch with old friends and relatives. I hate the adds, friend suggestions, and like suggestions. I use privacy settings but there still is not enough privacy. I want to be able to mark that only close friends can see my phone and email but I do not get that option. There are times the suggestions annoy me so much I start getting tempted to delete my account.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app is nice for going on my profile or that of friends, or chatting with a single friend. However, it very often hates to load and constantly crashes. Also, there is no way to put your newsfeed in chronological order, so reading some friends posts gets really jumbled because you will read one from a few hours ago long before you ever see the newer ones that supplement the older post. Sometimes, i find it easier to just go to safari to look at the posts on facebook. At least i can sort things there. The chat stuff is just annoying. I mean, how do you get rid of the group chats on the side? You can easily exit out of a single one, but not a group chat. And the bobbles just get annoying. You try to click on them and instead they move and vise versa. An okay app, but needs a lot of work.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
4 years of Facebook and they still can't get the app right. Freezes, takes ages to load then just closes. It puts me off facebook using the app. Facebook is fine, the app needs sorting out!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Oh how I wish the iPad app was as good as the iPhone version! On the little phone screen Facebook is beautiful! I see full photos and longer posts, cover photos, it's fast and never crashes... iPad version, total opposite! Why do I have a bigger screen yet see less content?? Photos are trimmed top & bottom, posts are shortened, no cover photos, teeny tiny profile pics, videos display even worse than photos.. The iPad is for graphically engaging the user, yet the Facebook app feels like I'm wearing blinders! It's better to open Facebook in Safari and use the full web version than to use an app that Facebook has total control over yet fumbles to create anything interesting.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Go back to the original version!! I KNOW I'm not the only one that says leave it alone and you guys just keep adding S**t and screwing it up even more!! Chrashing, slow, adds I don't want to see suggested apps. Don't even know why I'm writing this. Not like you'll listen or even read.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
great app for iphone :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Why oh why can't they make it not crash every day???	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It's a great site to stay in touch with friends, new & old.  :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
With the newest/current upgrade this app has some great new features, my favorite one is the continuous crashes! Can't attach or share or open!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app seems to be convenient and in some ways is, but those chat heads are simply annoying. I like to look at my messages full-screen, and there should be some way to hide the bubbles for good. Currently, you can hide them, but the next time the person messages you, it reappears. I want to be able to get completely rid of them! Furthermore, just about every five minutes, the app crashes! I lose everything I had typed in Messages and it's extremely irritating.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It always crashes and I have to re-open it and it just crashes again?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I want to see all my updates, not a wiggly line where updates should be.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Good Esta Mejorando Un Poco Despacio En El Celular Pero Creo Que Pueden Mejorarlo	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Within two minutes the app crashed 3 times. You can't look at photos on the app or it will crash. It usually takes 2-3 tries before the app will even opens up. Super slow and crashes too much to use.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the last upgrade the app keeps freezing and I have to delete and re-install to make it work again. I also hate the grey bar at the top that tells you someone has commented, that's what the red icons are for!! Loved this app before this.. Change it back please!!!! Update: wrote the above yesterday.. Have had to delete and reinstall twice since then.. This used to be a great app.. SORT IT OUT PLEASE!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This version is the best yet of Facebook however my newsfeed is never 'Most Recent' when I choose this option. Can this be changed? I know my friends update all the time but it shows the same friends over and over again even when they post something the day before when I'm in 'most recent' newsfeed mode. Thanks!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app works ok, but it will close out randomly an you have to attempt to open it several times before it will actually open. Also I wish we could comment in a status when you share a photo or link	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app works pretty good most the time. Rarely glitches on me. But what I dislike is that, since I keep 2 accounts, I have to constantly log out and log in and all that. Twitter has a nice little function to just switch accounts fast and nicely, I believe Facebook should also have this function for those like me who need to manage multiple accounts	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Loads slowly, can't see my friends unless I go into my profile and it takes forever to load up anything on anyone else's profile and photos!!! Plus now it forecloses every time until it finally loads!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It crashes a few times before it will open. I like that now we can add feelings and what we are eating/doing like the website. It's still slow though	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This is a "0" star because it has refreshed in 3 days. Horrible.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great for keeping up with friends and discussing issues.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Update is great.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Shuts down intermittently.  Sometimes have to start it 2 or 3 times before it stays running.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Don't go a day without opening it.Thanks Facebook, Apple, and all those involved with getting this app on the iPhone	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great for socialising!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
This app crashes constantly even if I don't have any back programs running. It will say that I have 6 notifications when I only have 2. And my messages don't always show up. A lot of the times it doesn't post my pictures. And it will say that I posted a status today when it was 2 days ago. Love the layout and love the idea of it. Just a few bugs.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Facebook is like one of the best websites for iPhone and so is the app because when u go to post something there is a emjoi thing where it will say feeling great so much fun and also. The messenger is as well. Thanks so much	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
How the heck do you get rid of group chat   So very annoying.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Updates do not take long to adjust to either.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app is great when it works which is a very rare event lately!!!!! Please fix!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app always crashes, the worst app in the App Store. An update means more crashes and its become more slow than the previous versions, sometimes I think that the developers doesn't know anything about apps!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes more, freezes more, too many commercials...compared to 2 years ago this is a marked deterioration when used on an IPAD. On my PC works very well, but still too many advertisements in the time line.It only gets worse as time passes.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook app is good but it has its moments. It keeps cutting off on me when I'm on it and sometimes it will take forever to load things. And it's not my service or anything. But other than that its a good app, I just wish that they would stop changing everything on it.....just fix the bugs and leave everything else alone.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Still getting false notifications! Example: the app will show on screen I have 10 notifications and when I enter the app all I have are 2. This has been a problem for too long no matter what I do.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
FB should pull this crummy update- major issues-wouldn't download correctly, then when it did- it bogged down to a crawl.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Liked	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Well I suppose I should have thought twice before allowing update to Facebook today.  It's been stick halfway thru it for 10 hrs now.  This is not nice.  Did you test downloads first?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I write a big reply then press post but it doesn't post it and it disappears???Have to copy everything before posting, Badge says I have 5 notifs, open app there's only 4?Badge always shows 1 more that inside the app!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Great app no problem	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
These updates are getting ridiculous. Make it simple.keep it simple.  The most recent update is still pathetic. Doesn't even stay most recent. And now going to your friends to search. No more alphabet to jump straight to and when you do select them and go back. Starta back at the top....  Someone create a new facebook please	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes not as often as the other but I hate it. It's slow.  Loads slower and pictures and videos take not as long but signing in and out and loading pages takes forever.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love Facebook but Facebook is not for minor special when the minor is ADHA... Please check is a lot a kid it not support	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
My Facebook was recently updated to the one where the new layout means all of your tabs such as "messages" and "notifications" are on the bottom of the page. All I can say is: "Go home, you are drunk." This is in no way easier to use, now when I scroll through my news feed I almost always open my messages, and although it isn't difficult to get back to where I was. It's annoying as heck. The rest of the features aren't bad, it's just the layout that lets it down... But hey, congratulations, Facebook, you are the the first and probably the only app I will ever review.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

hi, I am a teenage girl that is CONSTANTLY on Facebook! I love it. my oy suggestion is you know how you can tag people, put your location ect, well I think that you should also be able to put hashtags! I love hashtaggjng & I'm sure other people do to, so I figure when not do an update where you can put hashtags on statuses & pictures! thanks!:)	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

The new like message is amazing, it literally made my life, the fact that it can only be sent at certain times however is quite annoying, if this were to be fixed I could see facebook making record profits	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It seems to me there is no way these updates ever get field tested.  It is so slow and doesn't even come up half the time. Stupid	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It's way too slow!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app used to be sharp but now due to cross platform application is seems devs are less inclined to make it work for the user. Im on iOS and my current experience is poor. Slow to respond, slow to update if ever. A real shame overwork has overindulged an app enjoyed for simplicity in its conception.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This app won't even open up. It always crashes and I can't go in fb but I have to onto the Internet if i want to use fb. It is really annoying that the update made it worse not better. :(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

The latest update for this app is a power hog. I do not get the performance I want. The News Feed misses status updates of friends that I am interested in. Given the amount of power this app is waiting, I'm seriously considering deleting it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
The new update is terrible!! Do not update it is full of bugs and crashes, sort it outDecent app normally	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

There really is no reason for me to have to click the "most recent " button to have the posts in order everytime I open the app,  It should always be "most recent" ..Now when I share a post the newsfeed changes to "newsfeed" instead of most recent No push notifications either anymore.. Keep trying, eventually someone will get a working version together we hope	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Yet again you have given us another pointless update yet still not fixed the basic stuff like text freezing ,delays in viewing pics and notifications ,sporadic page notifications and constantly not being able to scroll back on the Messenger system Sort out the foundations before adding another story to this decrepit building site	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Not happy with Facebook, the most recent newsfeed doesn't work and I'm always seeing posts from hours or days ago, the app crashes all the time, it says I have notifications when I don't, you keep changing things but not taking into consideration what people are complaining about.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes at least once every 2 days.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Nice.Takes long to show the amount of likes and comments someones pics have when scrolling through them, never had this problem before the update.Just 'news feed' should already be most recent. I shouldn't have to select it every time i go on facebook!Also, the app STILL crashes and closes itself. How have you possibly not fixed this yet? You make billions more than other companies, their apps work fine, surely yours should too! (Also, it's not crashing because my phone is old, because it isn't, it's an iPhone 5, so it should work)TEST YOUR APPS BEFORE RELEASING THEM!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
It's cute with the little circles for the messages c:	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This is the worst app ever. Unusable. Crashes constantly. Doesn't load most recent news feed. It takes several minutes to open a picture. My phone is so fast on everything else. Facebook: stop adding features and fix what you've already got!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook it's to slow . I can even check , my messages cuz it freezes every time , come on do something :/	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

For some reason, the app constantly has a badge saying that I have 2 new notifications even though I have none. It won't go away even after restarting my device.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is horrible, the developers of this app have just let it go down hill. Facebook in general has gone down hill. It crashes way to much, I have to re open it over and over and by the time it finally lets me use it, I don't even want to use it anymore. It's not my phone. It's this horrible app. I used to love the old Facebook app, smooth and simple, now there's way too much. What makes me mad is when Facebook alerts me when people update their status, post pictures, or when it's someone's birthday. I DON'T CARE!! I can see they posted a status when I'm on my news feed! I don't need annoying notifications. That's pretty sad that this app has to send notifications just so people have a reason to click on it and use it. Because if it didn't, I wouldn't touch this app ever again. Simply horrible.Would have rated it lower but the lowest you can put is one star.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love FB, when u need to let out some thing FB is what u need....!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I read a few reviews and guess I don't have the same issues as often. The amount of data that is crossing the line is the issue. There's a lot of data so just remember to shut down your device once a week. Same with any computer! I love Facebook, even with the changes. I just make the time to get used to it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Bad app for a bad website. I still use it tho cause I'm a tool with no life. Update: I can no longer use this app because any time I open it, there's a connection error. You should be getting paid to download this useless pile of junk, and in addition, iTunes should allow you to rate zero stars, solely for this app. Update: app still doesn't work, I had to use a third party tweak to get it to stay open for more than 10 seconds.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

My personal fb is ok...wish you'd stop changing stuff all the time and the hash tag is stupid. Since creating a page for my photography my opinion had gone down even further.

I really like the new update except that it tells me I have notifications, but it won't let me see them, it won't update my news feed or notifications. I love the chat bubbles and all the new buttons at the bottom, and the new features in the status update. Please fix!!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Most of the time it's easier to use my iPhone when it doesn't crash or finally does open. I can add photos to my personal page albums but I can't to my other pages, not good.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Very laggy, message icon does not change when message received, order of 'Most Recent' status updates is random and makes no sense. Some updates do not even show in my News Feed. This app gets worse at each update. This is an awful app Facebook. Don't you guys even test it???	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Regardless of it crashing or failing to even run, all in all it runs rather slow.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a great way to keep in touch with ur friends across the water	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It's a great app while it's working...which is about half the time. Loading takes a very long time, and it's twice as slow with pictures, where it crashes most of the time. So annoying.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

QUIT putting suggested apps and suggested pages in my feed. I keep hiding them and FB keeps bringing them back. Leave my wall alone!Also I am VERY tired of it crashing all the time.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
For the love of god, how many times is this app going to have a pop up screen showing me how to enable push notifications?!  It comes up repeatedly while checking recent notifications and must be dismissed every time. I DON'T WANT PUSH NOTIFICATIONS!  IF I DID, I WOULD TURN THE CRAP ON! I DON'T WANT FB CRAP TAKING OVER MY PHONE!!  STOP OFFERING ME REPEATED DIRECTION TO TURN IT ON!! IT IS ANNOYING AS SIN!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's alright, but as always there's something lacking. I really don't like the way I basically can't look at photos (enlarge and whatnot) without the caption overlay popping back over it. It makes it incredibly difficult to see bits of the photo and I frankly annoying.Also I hate the way the whole news feed jumps around while it automatically updates itself - I can't do anything while its bouncing, and have to wait for it to finish! What's the point of 'pull down to refresh' then?!Otherwise, an alright update.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

App interface is not bad, but not great.  When posting updates in current location it seems to eat a lot if bandwidth and takes forever to load listing.

Great app on IPhone ( I use IPhone 4 ), the only problem is it sometimes takes 2-3 attempts to open the app without it shutting me out before loading. I'd have chalked I up to a phone flaw, but it's the only app I use that does it. ( I use many Internet-based apps ).	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

I need to use Facebook to communicate with school and sports groups, and this app won't let me do that. To begin with, it might take six tries to open the app in the first place. And once it does open, it might not even update anything. In fact, it often shows me statuses and other things from 2-3 weeks ago, and then will not update to anything new for days, just give me other old things. And if I'm trying to message with one of my team members, the app will most often crash several times before I can get any message sent. The bubbles on the screen for messaging are a good idea, but they are very slow, and make the app crash. So all in all, if I didn't need to have Facebook on my iPod, I wouldn't.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I check Facebook every day, and I have very few issues with its functionality, except when it comes to videos. If I watch a video within my feed, it usually crashes halfway through. Recently I tried watching a six-minute video and it crashed three times. Following a link that leads to a video also leads to problems. The video sometimes crashes, or it simply refuses to load. This all means that I have begun to associate videos on Facebook with my PC laptop, and that my iPad is just for skimming (i.e. not fully functional).	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Ever since the 3 latest updates Facebook has been closing down on me once in a while, and cancels everything I was doing. I thought I was the only one, but a few of my friends with the iPhone have been having the same problems. Please fix them!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Now I have to go into 'more' in order to access my profile... Not user friendly, bring older style back! Don't like icons at bottom either, last 1 was fine leave it ** sigh!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Updated the app this morning and now complete and utter rubbish. Constant problems. Come on and get it sorted. Very unhappy customer :-(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This app is amazing. You get to keep up to date with other people and its a way to chat to people you don't have the chance to. I know it may have some faults but overall i think this app is excellent	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
What happened to my chat bubbles? Now I can't even open my messages...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app crashes constantly. Any review giving this app positive feedback is fake, unless people like the fact that you can barely even use it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
weak sauce....please fix...used to work fine...now crash,crash,crash	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seriously, if this app crashes ONE MORE TIME I will delete it and just use Safari on my iPhone.  I was planning on yesterday's update to fix the crashing issues and it only made it worse.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time i open it it crashes probably 3 times then works but recently i had to delete the app and redownload it this is my weekly ritual fix it !!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This is getting ridiculous. Every update just makes it worse.'Most recent' means the last things that have happened, not things that happened several hours ago, THEN the most recent.Still rarely get friends news in my news feed and I've checked all the settings.So disappointing. I'd rather just log onto Facebook via explorer than use this app.Please test your updates properly.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Too much lag . At some point I can't even click on picture because its lagging too much . Sometime I can wait 20 sec before the image finally pop out . Fix it please , awefull.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Can't tag photos. Crashes. Is delayed in processing a comment that has been added, does not show anything new on my wall since the update.Boo.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Oh let's see how people are holding up oh but first I have to wait for this to crash okay now I can view Facebook oh nope it crashed guess I need to reopen it crash ugh just delete it before you even install this stupid app	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It keeps crashing. Ever since i downloaded the new update, every time I open it, BOOM! It crashes. Can you fix it soon?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
This app is frozen during the installation of the update. I don't think I can do anything about it, either. I should've read the other reviews before updating this.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Remember when the Facebook App actually worked ???? Who are these jokers saying great and fab??? Either blind and stupid or employees of Facebook. We all know it does not work but they can't be bothered to fix it. Time maybe we all drop the old FB!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This is a great app I used it all the way to la in the car and talked to my friends a great app for traveling	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Update this morning and can no longer log on, keeps timing out. So have deleted it. Pants! You have been warned!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Liked the app the way it was before with the navigation on the left side, and notifications on the top. With the navigation on the bottom, it takes up screen space and is very noticeable especially after using the previous version of the app. Other than that its an excellent app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Takes forever to load (no its not my wifi) always randomly closes on me. They took away the blue links and replace them with black bold letters which I don't see the point in. I can't figure out how to delete comments or tag people in pictures before you post them- you have to upload the picture then tag in the comment. The app before this one was a much much better version.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I found the app's News Feed is missing several posts when I compare it to the web page.  Makes me worry I've missed stuff over time.  Will not be using the app for the time being.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still lacks the option to choose pictures from my photo stream albums...  App crashes.Posts order doesn't stick, i want to order as most recent, but it never stays that way!!!Plz fix that	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Very nice app I have a lot family and I used all time	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I honestly think Facebook should be a little faster when using 3G.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes sooooo much!!!!!  And it's terrible cuz it's usually when I'm on some obscure page reading something fascinating.  Also the videos stop playing in the middle and I have to restart them.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It crashes TOO MUCH. I can't even tap on a picture or go to chat. Even after reloading the app it continues to crash. I downloaded Facebook not crapbook	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It crashes way to much , Ill go to type  a paragraph and it will crash , also if I take a picture it will crash . Please fix this problem . I dont like the bubbles either their annoying . So basically just update facebook .	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
...and you hire developers straight outta high school. What is wrong with you people? I stopped "downgrading" at 5.2. If you "downgraded" to 6.2 and want to go back delete it and go sync. Provided you haven't synced since you "downgraded" you should get your old version back.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
FFS when will they actually read these reviews and do something about it??	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Ok so now we gain little icons in the status but lose the ability to paste links properly. Any chance we'll ever get a fully functioning App?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Always updating and freezing up deleting this app	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app and iPhone 4 go together as good as Vodka and Lucky Charms. It takes forever for anything to load and the app shuts off on its own all the time and you have to re enter the app!!! And you don't get as much content as in posts on iPhone as you do on your Computer. Two Thumbs Down !!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I wish you could view the photo albums on a "business's" page instead of viewing all the photos at once .. its confusing !	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
App crashes repeatedly!! clicking on pictures, continue reading, or a group takes FOREVER (45 seconds to a full minute to load/respond) so I click it again and end up three screens ahead of where I wanted to go!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Este nueva version y la anterior no SIRVEN! Cuando tratas de entrar a Facebook no te deja, se queda pensando. Cuando porfin logras entrar los estados y las fotos no cargan se queda pensando y te muestra los estados viejos. El chat no suena cuando te hablan. He tenido que utilizar safari por que la aplicacion de ninguna forma me deja hacer nada, no sirve. Arreglen esos errores YA!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
An update should make an application works better, not become worst. keep crashing!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Maybe you guys should concentrate on making the app not crash every 5 seconds instead of adding stupid emotion faces to a message. Facebook is everything that is wrong with society these days.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My app has crashed at least 20 times in the last 4 hours..Keeps crashing when loading random things... chat, images, profiles, etc. When I'm responding to people...Please fix! Otherwise this is a great and convenient app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Keep taking extremely long to load ANYTHING only on Facebook. Restarted the phone, uninstalled, reinstalled, logged out, logged in. Tried it all and it's been really slow since the update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
For the last two weeks my Facebook service has been appalling. It drops out and closes when ever I am in the middle of a chat. I cannot access the pages I like to visit properly - I cannot see other members' comments and I cannot comment myself even if I open the link to those particular Facebook pages in my browser. It has become a truly asocial social network. I updated this morning in the hope that would improve things, but alas no. The fixes have not fixed anything. Please resolve this Facebook - and stop filling my feed with irritating suggestions about games I may like to play or commercial behemoths I would like to 'like'. If I liked them I would shop there. I do not wish my newsfeed to be littered with their incessant marketing. I come on Facebook to relax and share information with friends - not to be browbeaten into liking your commercial sponsors/ shareholders. Very poor service just now.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Not liking the new Facebook update for the iPhone. It puts the notifications and everything at the bottom of the screen. Too easy to hit the buttons and change out of what I was reading.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I try and open the app and I have to open it a few times for it to actually open and then I try and look at pictures on profiles and it crashes the app and when I try to upload pictures it does the same thing, it crashes. These problems need to me fixed, I usually don't right reviews but this needs to be fixed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
To whomever is responsible for this app, you should be sad and embarrassed as I am sure their friends and family are the most embarrassed as they should for being friends or related to the biggest failure in the history of app developers. How you have ever been gainfully employed is amazing as you should definitely be on disability since you are obviously handicapped and if you have been denied your right to disability benefits all you need to do is show them this app as it definitely will be the proof you need to qualify for a claim. I'll be waiting for a sleazy law firm to file a class action lawsuit against you so I can be compensated for all my time lost that clearly you are responsible for. Good luck in your future endeavors at sucking at life, sincerely the guy trying to help you get the help you need	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Since the newest update I have been logged out of the games that I have on my phone that use Facebook connect and it won't let me reconnect... Also... There has not been one time that I've had fb on here that I don't have to open numerous times just to get it to load... Can't view pictures either unless you want it to force close on you... Please fix soon	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I was keeping my fingers crossed that the next update would reform the Facebook app into a speedy worthwhile app. No, I was wrong. Another waste of space. Same problems, just even worse. Do Facebook not test these updates before release?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Awful	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Now I can't save photos. Please fix all these crazy bugs. Very disappointed in this update. New update won't let me hide posts on my feed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's better than its been for a while, but it's still frustrating. The app should realise I have fb messenger installed and not notify me about chat messages! Or at least the chat notification should go away if I open it in messenger...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
The update force quits about half of the time I use the app. Mostly when I'm trying to message someone.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm in the middle of updating it and it won't update!!!!!! It keeps sending me a notification every five minutes saying.... Facebook could not update at this time..... Seriously!?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I think this app is getting worse and worse....I have tried to change some things on my profile for about a week now and all it's saying is "please try again later." I am getting so annoyed with this app. Please sort it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Arguably just as good or better than the PC version	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Before the update, it was easy to use! Now it takes a lot of effort to get to groups, pages, events etc. New layout is horrible!!I might go back to using Facebook through Safari which is horribly slow and glitchy!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Updated my Facebook app last night, now the app is gone! When I try to re-download the app, it won't let me! It says open not install! And the open button won't even work!!! Fix this	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The latest update is a pain on the eyes!! When scrolling the pages are very jerky and not smooth like before!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Still doesn't set "Most Recent" to stay and always goes back to top stories! And now with this update it shows a few newly posted statuses from my friends and then after a few it switches to statuses from hours ago or the day before and all the new ones are no where to be seen!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Congratulations on this almost version of the Facebook app. To put it another way ewwwww ewwwww ewwww. What happened?? The iStore said "update"...this comes across more out of date. There seem to be massive format errors with overlaps between posts in the news feed, bits go missing and then come back, we've regressed back to having a menu bar at the left and chat at the right (just after REALLY getting used to the most recent layout)...the bad list goes on. I'm a Facebook fan...get me out of here!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Apart from the embarrassing ongoing notification sounds problem still, the ads are very annoying and newsfeed seems to put things in whatever order it wants, no matter which view you're in?? Why's it so difficult to display things in date/time order?Just seems that existing problems aren't being fixed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
How can they get every single update so spectacularly wrong. Terrible for an official app, and unforgivable with all the money they have. Barely stable and nothing works or displays properly.  Crashes on startup 95% of the time. Numpties. Utter 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I am extremely disappointed in the newest version of this app. I am constantly being kicked off in the middle of writing a message or just scrolling through my news feed. I can't seem to get anything done because I'm repeatedly kicked off at random times. Like I said, I am very disappointed and displeased.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app works perfectly fine on my iphone5	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The update is horrible. The app crashes constantly, doesn't load, is super-slow, and you still can't type in landscape mode. Each update seems to make the app worse instead of better! This is about the 10th time I've had to re-download this app since the most recent update because it keeps crashing and then it gets to the point where it won't even open until you delete it and download again.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The app is very smooth and fast. The only issue I come across is the occasional crash.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This app is pure junk. It lags, it freezes, & it crashes like a mother****er. On more than one occasion, it has refused to open at all, forcing me to uninstall the app, restart my phone, reinstall it, & sit around waiting for it to happen again. I do not recommend this. Just use safari to access Facebook (~_~')	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app to have! I can connect with friends and family anytime, anywhere!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The layout of the new Facebook app is unpleasant to the customer! Most customers have been giving this new Facebook one star; it's mostly because it looks terrible! Sure it's more practical, straightforward if you say so; yet it would be better if you renovated it! Renovate it to be easier to use than the previous version, yet make it appealing to the eye (of course)! Still don't stray towards any other color (black!) stick to the Facebook colors you've chosen!        You all fail as a developer! You strive to make the app faster yet you add useless features (like the ugly black bar at the bottom) and slow it down again! You blatantly ignore looks and usefulness! How can you do such a stupid thing and put your app in jeopardy like that! I mean have you looked at your reviews lately!?        You should now try to make your app at least moderately appealing and intriguing! I expected more from a company in fact any company should do better than that! I am incredibly disappointed by your performance you have become bland and you sincerely remind me of a failing company!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I don't like that my newsfeed gets clogged up with my friends' likes and comments on other people's pictures or status updates. The only option I have on my phone is to not show in newsfeed. Getting tired of not seeing actual status updates!Can't post on business pages! Why the changes?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The latest update is now prone to hanging. The app only wishes to work at home. Terribly buggy and awkward.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I love FB	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Gets worse and less user friendly with every upgrade.Frequent crashes and lots of absolutely unnecessary complications make it less desirable till its got to the stage I'm terrified to upgrade my version any more!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

This app fails to load on first, second, and sometimes, third attempt. Being forced to look at 'Suggested Pages' and ads that can only be gotten rid of by reporting them as spam makes using the iPhone version a frustrating and exhausting mess, that I tend now to avoid, rather than accept. It's crap.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the last update, Facebook has been horrible!!  It will crash randomly. Statuses and photos won't load, the same with comments. I hope they get this fixed!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am not very impressed since I downloaded the update my Facebook won't load at all I have tried deleting and re downloading the app	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I Just got the iPhone5 Right before this last update and it worked fine. Since this last update all it does is crash I uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice and it still crashes. This is absolutely horrible app. The updates make it worse instead of better.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app doesn't work with the new update!!! Nothing will load on 5 different wifi networks.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I would rate this 1000 stars (:	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
BUT REALLY. It is the most frustrating thing how this app is CONSTANTLY CRASHING. Get it together Facebook my god.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With the addition of the last several updates, it seems to only get worse with crashing constantly or freezing up only to, again, crash! Also, I like to keep my newsfeed on most recent but constantly have to reset that as well! I check FB daily so I don't need to see what I already read the day before!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
My sound is on for this app and for the past five thousand updates there are no sound for when I receive a notification. It also keeps saying I have some when I don't. Stupid app	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
From the other reviews, looks like lots of people are having problems with the app crashing.  I'm not having any problems-/ works fine, nice app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Occasional bumps in the road are expected, especially with a technology so rapidly changing as Facebook, but come on guys, you can do better than this...With the current version of the App, I am patently unable to see certain posts or comments that I can clearly see exist when I check in Mobile or from the web. The case that spawned this review is such that I could see a notification that multiple comments were waiting for me, but I couldn't see them. Worse, I could infer from surrounding comments that they carried information important to me.It wouldn't be so bad if the problem improved when I attenpted to update the post, or when I shut down the App and restarted it, or restarted my phone and tried it all again, but the problem persists now, an hour later.So what makes this bad enough to warrant a 1-star rating? In simplest terms, for a communications app to make communications *more difficult* is unacceptable. This bug is directly preventing me from effectively being able to carry on conversations (much less the business they carry).	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With the amount of times I'm asked to update this app it's not worth it. Stop adding new features and fix the app itself. Crashes often. Extremely slow load time. When I try to see my most recent feed I expect to see the most recent things not yesterday's stuff even after updating the feed multiple times.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Slow to connect and keeps cutting off!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
This app has good sides, and Facebook is nice to use here. I like the chatting idea. The browsing is good. But it lacks many things that are needed in an app. We should be able to crop out our profile picture by this app, it doesn't let us crop at all! And it crashes so many times! Ohh! This is so annoying! Crash, crash, crash! That's so aggravating! Fix that!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
It's a ok app no problems at times,but crashes a lot	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The snails pace and crash-proneness of this app reminds me of the Internet access I used to deal with while traveling abroad in 2004.  Seriously slow and seriously frustrating...but you put up with it because you kinda have to.  I am about to chuck the app altogether some days and just use my browser.Also, I do agree, it would be nice if the app had the same functionality as the full site.  Like why can't I share a post to my Facebook page like I can online? These little things frustrate me to no end...like enough that I actually wrote this review!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Yeah it crashes a lot but whatever happened to "landscape mode!" That was the best part and then it went away. Please bring that back before you do anything else. Of course you don't care cause we'll just have to deal with it right? Whatever.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like a lot of features but I feel like you should be able toDelete more than one photo at a time in the albums. I know you can delete the whole photo album but I'mNot sure if you can delete more than one photo in it at the time. (On the app or on an actual computer).	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Used to very much like FB, but updates mean I can't see or post on sites like QVC and more on iPhone and iPad its VERY ANNOYING! I've complained so many times and I'm not the only one! Get it sorted please, and those dam flashing adds stating I've one a iPhone /pad etc or my PCM has a virus or mail, PLEASE STOP THIS CRAP!! Totally fed up with it all! FB used to be fun, not any more!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It's a good app but sometimes it takes a lot of time to load my notifications & it closes the app by its self -.- please fix that thanks	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
My only issue (iPhone 5 user) is that Facebook seems to have problems loading the most recent posts sometimes. Other than that, it runs smooth.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I like like the Facebook app but I am giving it a 1 star because it messed up the chat. I mean I can still chat good but still... It is not that great. I can get on people's wall and mine great but it messed up the chat. So if you do Facebook chat do not upgrade Facebook. They could have done better  then that... I like the one before the upgrade and I hate it showing the news all the time.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Between trying Facebook for iPad a few months ago, and now, many significant improvements have been made and now, I almost prefer it to accessing through Safari.  Some things could still be improved, like a delete spam button and being able to navigate away from the app while chatting and know if whomever you are chatting with has replied.  Also, quite irksome is not being able to play some videos within the app.  I imagine they'll get there, eventually.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

not sure how long the "New Stories" button has been part of this app but its completely unnecessary and just gets in the way. really don't know why this was implemented in a constantly changing stream that is, by definition, always "new".let's get rid of that in the next release shall we?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This is the worst app on my phone. It freezes constantly, the app shuts down and closes unexpectedly. I am writing this now because it has been frozen on the same news feed story for 4 hrs and that happens all the time. Photos also freeze frequently.....What a joke, such a big name company can't create an app that performs its basic functions properly?! I've been losing interest in FB for a while...this might seal the deal.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps crashing and freezing. I hate the pop up chat that you have to drag to the x at the bottom. If I want to look at private or chat messages I'll go to them when I'm ready, not have to move them cos they're in the way and annoying	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	New Zealand

I don't check as often now. I genuinely like fb but this new update for apple I wish I never had done! It's poor and not user friendly! No profile option! What is that all about? Icons at the bottom? Why I could just slide to the left before that was much better. For crying out loud I just like to look at status's and my profile and it just seems harder and harder every update. Come on please just simplify like it used to be! This update is CRAP!!!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It crashes too often. I have trouble loading anything beyond the basic newsfeed. It usually crashes if I try and open anything besides the newsfeed. The Search ability is incredibly slow even on high-speed wifi. I only use this app for the sake of convenience as opposed to using a web browser. I hope they come out with an update soon that can fix the issues I have mentioned:1.) Crashing on everything aside from Newsfeed 2.) Slow search capabilitiesIf these were to be fixed soon I will continue to use it and suggest it to others. As it stands now, I will probably soon delete the app and go with a web browser, and I would offer up the suggestion to avoid this app. The app looses ints convenience as soon as you open it. I really would like to see improvements made on this app and soon.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If you want your personal info sold to corporations and given freely to the government, and if you want an app with progressively less features and more junk (read: ads) then this app is for you!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am constantly on facebook. You can ask my husband. My problem with the app is that it is entirely too slow to load, i always have to tap "most recent" and even then I see posts from the day before! I still hate that I can't turn my phone sideways and type on the keyboard horizontally! This app could be SO much better!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I finally got it to function, but not well. It keeps closing for no reason, and it won't stay locked in the landscape position. I am now SO sorry I updated this app! It worked fine before.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
You guys are a billion dollar corporation, pretty sure you can pay someone to fix these bugs. Cant even use the app longer than a minute. Sick of clicking anything and then it crashes.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
FB is great for the social media side of things. The one complaint that I have is that you can't do certain things on an iPad and you have to do them from a laptop or desktop.Outside of that, as long as they don't keep changing things on it all the time, I think it's a great tool to use for both personal and business side of life.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

Every since the last update that you all made, The Facebook app is entirely too slow now Loading. And after I have Squirrel about three pages and on Facebook crashes then I have to go back on Facebook then it will crash again it will do this about three times before letting me back on. But it is extremely slow when the app is Running. And also two, the accessibility will not read pictures to me so therefore I cannot share them with my friends, because I will not share a picture that I don't know what it says. So if you can make it 100% accessibility For all post statuses and pictures I would appreciate that please. And on accessibility when I go to a page to push like on it, it won't let me push like or share all it says is more when I click on it it tells me to share the page I'm not wanting to share the page when I first liking it it won't give me The option to push like on it. So if you can please fix these problems I will gladly rate Facebook five stars thank you	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It freezes all the time doesn't matter what your on. ( Computer or iPhone) then when it does come up it crashes.

This recent update you've done to Facebook has slowed the app down so much!! It wasn't the quickest beforehand but was ok for a phone. But since I've downloaded the latest, it takes close to 20 minutes to load the news feed when I open up my app and still pings me with notifications but cannot get to see them as it takes forever to load!! Very, very disappointed in this latest version. Sort it out, QUICK!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

FB is a great way to keep in contact with friends & family, especially those who don't live locally! Also, a good way to locate someone you have lost contact with over the years! Stay in the loop & up to date with community events & things going on around you. It is a convenient & safe way to get rid of/sell things your not wanting anymore &/or find good bargains on thins your wanting/needing! Just a little warning tho....it can get very addicting! Haha, but that's a good thing for FB!;) *****	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

1). Why can't the cover photo in the app maintain the same size/resolution as it appears on the browser/desktop version? Cover Photos get cut off at the sides with this app, and given how much money Facebook INC. has, you'd think this menial detail would be attended to.2). Why can't we customize our audiences more specifically, and more easily, in the app? I have to set my audience parameters in the browser version if needed...which makes me wonder why I bother using the app at all?3). Why can't we edit comments in the app?4). App is also very slow when looking at images. It takes forever to load an image after you tap it, and then when the image finally opens, it closes back again. Lame.5). Also.....why are posts so out of order? My settings are set to show posts in "Most Recent" order, yet I get 12 posts from last night before I see a post made 5 minutes ago. The browser version is fine, what's the issue with the app?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Everytime I inbox somebody it only shows me half of what they say back and it closes out of it. It won't show pictures that I get sent and it always freezes. Do better.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Only problem I have now or I see is why when wanting to write an status it doesn't show the iPhones keyboard anymore? It shows now pics instead of the keyboard, thought that's why theirs a photo update button & a status update for writing not another photo update thing.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I use this daily with little to no problems. So much better and faster than using a browser. My only problem I have with it is that it occasionally crashes and will need to be reopened. I definitely recommend this to the average Facebook addict.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

It's unpredictable, have to delete and reload. Constantly changed just for change sake. Don't see people I want no matter how many times I fix my settings. Awful. Huge inconsistency between phone, Ipad, web version of News Feed. Most recent is never actually most recent. Worst app ever. If it wasn't Facebook no one would use the app. I don't use the iPad version, I use Safari, but too small on my phone so I'm forced to use it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This version keeps going "No stories to show" when I go from a friend's wall back to my Newsfeed. The Newsfeed loads, but the delay is irksome for a busy person like me who can only spare a few minutes at a time.

I am generally pro-Facebook. But why can't the Messages app features be included into the Facebook app? I'll be in Facebook and tap on the iOS notification and it will switch apps to Messages. Talk about redundant. If you remove Messages, there is an ad that appears encouraging you to try it.Chat Heads have me considering removing the App all together and reverting back to using the website. I have an iPhone 4S and these things take up a substantial amount of room. Not to mention are distracting and silly. Is elegance out of the question? At least let me toggle the childish gimmick off, PLEASE.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I have to admit, the app keeps getting better. It still has issues, but let's be honest, a lot of us use it more than any other app; that counts for something.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is very useful. The only thing that that I think would better it is to make it where i could turn my screen sideways. Other than that, I love this app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
We spoke, they listened...kinda. Improved audience editing, faster messaging capabilities but there's no vine/snapchat style video clip option...you're falling behind FB.

This ap is horrible! I don't understand why I don't have any problems with the functionality of my FB app on my iPhone 5 but it crashes repeatedly or just fails to update on my iPad???

So I never write reviews. But the Facebook app updates are so so so absolutely pathetic and horrible that I could not stay quiet about it anymore. It doesn't open. It doesn't update. It's basically might as well not be there. This new update was supposed to fix the fact that it crashed frequently. Well they sure as hell fixed it! How can something that doesn't even open, crash at all?! I am disappointed beyond words that a publicly traded company puts out products worse that a 3 year olds science projects. Fix it ASAP, or consider one user less on your Facebook app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

However my iPod Touch 4th Generation struggles to process the data required for this app. So much that it crashes when I'm browsing and when I load it up. It has it's good and bad days. But overall it's a good app and the new bubble head chat feature is amazing!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

It works (most of the time), as a customer I do not need new features daily or even monthly, I just want it to work, with less spam in the news feed. The reason I left MySpace was because of all the constant updates. Now I'm just waiting on my friends to switch to Google+ so I can delete this app too.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Rubbish , stops working all the time and is so annoying!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This app just gets worse with every update. It now takes an age to open any pictures and even crashes sometimes. Choosing between different timelines is a pain and results in me completely missing half the day at times. Facebook resting on their laurels and taking it got granted that people will continue to use it regardless!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

issues with horizontal/vertical viewing.New sharing screen is slow-even scrolling is sluggish.Update: buttons keep changing for sharing a post. Won't hold settings of who can see your posts. Have to change from computer for custom setting if you change settings for a specific post.Second update: can't handle saving scrolling settings. Defaults to highlights or whatever. If you change to most recent, and you comment or share, it defaults back and you have to reset EVERY SINGLE TIME. Hardly worth using to read wall.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Unlike every other version that loaded quickly and basically functions, this version just loads constantly with no conclusion.  I have deleted and reloaded, same problem.   Certainly considering the need for the app on the phone.  If that's the case, it's only one step to disinterest in Facebook altogether.Do better.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I agree they keep updating to often and lately if had been very very very slow to up date the news feed and always closing!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
The FB app is my primary method of interacting with FB. The iPad version has an annoying bug that jumps you back pages when you share. It doesn't do this on iPhone / iPod Touch. Notifications should stay highlighted until I read them. I wish the app had some of the features available on Fera, but I'd guess FB considers them 'illegal'.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Loads quick, but that could be the 4G LTE, not necessarily the app. I don't like that you can't fully edit a post or picture like you can on the web version. Wish I could load most recent always on my news feed. Also most recent doesn't always display in chronological order. But functional, overall. I think I was just used to the version I had on my iPod touch and then had to switch to this one.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I have a iPhone 4S and latterly my Facebook app is just closing after I've been in it for 30 seconds. I have asked around and a lot of other people's is doing it too. FIX IT. And take those stupid bubbles away, worse thing ever.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It drives me crazy how slow this app goes and that it crashes at least 3 times a day. If Facebook wants to keep on top as being a number 1 place to go for social media they need to get on the ball on improving their APPS. Maybe dump the idea of having a Facebook Phone and improve the thing people actually use, THE APP!!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This crashes about 5-6 TIMES before it actually opens up it is one of the worst apps EVER ! If I can rate this half a star I would !!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook people - what is going ON?? I am starting to dread seeing an update for this app as you never seem to be able to actually fix the same bugs I've had for months.It takes ages to update and refresh my home page - new stories are chronologically out of time even though they are meant to be sorted by Most Recent - I get an email notification to say that someone has commented on something and then maybe about an hour later I get the notification show up on Facebook itself.What is going ON?  We appear to be going backwards with the reliability and usability of this app.I'm considering deactivating my account.   It shouldn't be this frustrating just trying to stay in touch.  Should it?!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I think it could be a lot better of an app. So many people are always on it. The circle faces on the side after an email are annoying.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Honest opinion? It is not up to even up to a horrible standard. It freezes, crashes, and worst of all at times will not advance chat. The one thing that I do like and the only reason you got 2 star is the large smileys that can be used in chat. My family loves those as well.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
All of the designs where nice, the new one is horrible..	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ever since adding the 'chat heads' the app crashes often whenever using the message function. From receiving pictures to just typing a message. Since adding the chat heads receiving messages has also been very laggy and can take up to 5mins to load some simple text and sometimes pictures won't even come through at all.With those issues resolved its a 5 star app. With the issues it's lucky to r a 3 star app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Either crashes right after launching or does not load content at all. Do us a favor and issue an update already. App is semi-useless as is.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Often I have to kill the app and restart it before I can check in some where.  Many things can not be edited from the app. Other than that I enjoy it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

The new update Has ruined this app. I used to be able to go when you change pictures on my Facebook page but not anymore. I have a main page for my personal use and a secondary page for my business use and I can no longer view or edit any of the photos of my business page. This app went from a four star for me down to one because it stop doing what I needed to do.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It's a good app in general, but when I have conversations with certain people the messages take a long time to load but then with others, it is fine? That really needs sorting! Also, the app crashes on a regular basis which is extremely irritating as it often happens as I am writing a message to my friend, whose conversation has just taken ages to load!

When I upload a new profile picture it asks me to crop the original picture and make-do with the cropped version which loses the wholesome feeling of a photo. Like misses the logo on a tshirt or a ship on the far right. It'd very nice of you if you could try and make it possible to keep the original picture but with a reposition option as in desktop Facebook. Thanks.

Please fix this app. It's slow and irritating -_____-	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The newsfeed bug (or is that feature) is about worthless. Ever since version 6, the news feed usability has been severely hampered. One cannot set the feed to most recent and have it be the default. (We used to be able to.). The newsfeed now is not updating like it should. It seems the app is getting worse, not better. I would rare it at zero stars if possible.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The good - it's Facebook on your phone.The bad - everything else.Crashes constantlyPainfully slow loading timesAwful updating of the news feed with hours missingThe app appears to have been written by a 3 year old. Pathetic.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Get rid of 'sponsored' links, apps and the "like" pages from my news feed - I don't want ads. There shld be an opt out options, like the "Do not call" list. I NEVER buy anything on FB, I don't play games, I don't like pages. I just want the friends only news feed and in order of latest news not s'thing a friend posted 5 days ago at the top before later news. New feed us USELESS!!It crashes in the middle of loading. What a joke, after all these years of complaints about the app and nothing has improved, it just keeps getting worse.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Love the app. Easy to maintain, and keep & touch with my friends. Althoee, I hope you're able to change timeline covers by now with iPads & delete albums as we wish & fix the crashing problem... Therefore, a great app. =)) By the way, (Written on another day) It seems that I can't like anything in my newsfeed. I mean like, everytime I like it, it seems to dislike back on its own. Does that mean that I liked too much news or something? FIX IT, IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE. thank you. 	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Why oh why does the app continually reset to "newsfeed" when I set it to "most recent"?  Takes too much of my time to see stories multiple times.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Every time I share a picture or create a status it shows on my news feed but when others check my profile, they can't see anything I posted.

Constantly crashing. Tried viewing photos and it crashes. Half way through typing a message and it crashes. Have to reopen the app 3 times before actually getting to use the app so that it can crash 5 mins later. One of the worst apps you can use.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebooks constant need to gather data drains my battery when I'm not even using the phone. I'm severely disappointed and the only way to fix the problem is close Facebook every time. The problem with that is that the Facebook app is very slow to open.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love using this app, layout is easy to navigate, notifications are good.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

It's relatively glitchy and extremely slow when it decides to work, but when it isn't 'cooperating', it's basically bringing up a black screen, then crashing a few seconds later. Please fix it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I'm very dissatisfied with the current version of Facebook, it Glitches, it freezes, and it force quits itself almost every time I try to use it. I know it's not the phone, it's something with the app and I can't believe it's been this long and they still haven't fixed it. It's getting ridiculous, but I don't have any other options use Facebook from my phone. So basically I'm stuck with a terrible version of an app that I'm sure could easily be fixed.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The Facebook app seriously gets worse with every update. Takes forever to open, takes a long time to fully load, and if you want to search for a page or look at pictures you may as well pull up a chair and get comfortable.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Literally every five minutes it crashes.  I'm in a middle of writing and it blanks and crashes.  I am reading comments, looking at pictures, it just crashes.  It's like a time bomb that I have to rush to look and write.  I don't want to rush every two seconds.  It has gotten so bad, I have to write messages in my Notes App just so Facebook doesn't lose what I have written.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Overall the features of the app are well done.  I have a few cons though...1.  Photo uploads...would like the ability to upload to established albums or create photo albums to upload to.  Function not there yet.2.  Changing settings for account cant be done thru the app.  You have to browse using safari to get to this functionality.  Would think at the very least the settings could be edited thru Pages Manager but you cant.3.  Changing the cover photo via app not an option.4.  Creating an event with the app...event can be created but the invite list population is very difficult as you cant see your entire list of friends without typing in the names one at a time.  Cumbersome when throwing a "large party".	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Peoples comments aren't being displayed in order, comments replying to someone else's comments often appears in front.

I Like The App Very Mych Doesnt Crash At All With Me But A Few Concerns.... Why Is It That You Can So Ceartin Things On The Facebook Desktop But Cant Do It On The Mobike App. For Instance To Look At Videos You Have To Scroll Through The Persons Whole Timeline.

What if you haven't got a computer and this app is all you got?! Sort it out... For the app to have 5 stars you've gotta let us arrange our albums and photos are selves and be able to delete them whenever...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

Very good GUI in my opinion, only draw back is that in crashes frequently on opening...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I use it everyday to get in touch with family and friends..	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app but always could use improvements!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes all the time Worst version ever U have to reopen it every 5 mins It Suddenly shuts down while doing stuff	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever time I try to upload a video it fails. Hope they fix this soon	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Not bad. For a surveillance app!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I use Facebook a lot, most of the interactions are using this app, I can't imagine what i did before I got my iPhone & the Facebook app ! The improvements have been great, simple, logical steps to making it all easier to use in daily life. Well done FB	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
You can't even change the cover photo and when you put only friends for messages random people who aren't your friends send you messages. Also for the profile picture you used to be able to use more than just the thumb nail of a photo. It didn't used to be this way and you used to be able to change your cover photo on any mobile device or iPad.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I honestly used to enjoy being on Facebook more often. Some of the dynamics that have been altered or replaced have made it a little bit less fun for me. Too many ads, suggestions and fake profiles as well as seeing the same pics, game requests etc as well. However I currently enjoy being able yo upload the pics, posts etc with much more ease. I am definitely having a better time w/the mobile app too. It alllows people to have the access as they would by being on my laptop/tablet, which is obv much more "on the go" capable. Just a few thoughts and suggestions on my end.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Nicee	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Seems like I'm akwayz picking up my phone to check this APP!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Well done!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I will be writing a message or a status then BAM it kicks me out , and it doesn't show all of the messages someone writes to me, sometimes it doesn't show me any messages at all but tells me I have one!!! If this problem could be fixed that would be awesome thanks !!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It crashes on occasion, cuts the edges off pictures and takes ages to update news feed. Was good until all these 'updates' took place!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Running slow and crashes! Not impressed hence 1 * come on this app should be running smoothly by now	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I like it. It's great!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
So far good.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I use it all day, every day, to keep up with my family, friends and teammates that are scattered all over the country.  It's easy to use and hardly ever crashes.  I have a 4s and it works fine.  I don't know what all the whiners are complaining about.  When's the last time they made something perfect?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Sum times it messes up but works gd for me thx	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
this app is so buggy it's ridiculous! comments don't load, can't tap on notifications & the old favorite - can't load pics half the time without deleting app & reinstalling. I don't get it... all this popularity & they can't get it right?!? how could you even release the latest update when it clearly DOESN'T WORK??	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashing is very often since last update when using fb chat. Fix it please.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
"This update fixes all the bugs." That's a lie and you know it Fuckerburg.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Es muy bueno	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love Facebook, but the App version could be much better.  Sometimes it takes 3 tries to even get it to open!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not all my albums pops up when choosing where to add a picture too. Other than that its find. Bug fixed (kicking you off)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I love it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Compared to when I first started using it, great improvement!! Constantly improving in my opinion, still needs some work but moving in the right direction now.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Does all the things described. Just annoys me that it can't quite seem to view pictures properly. You click a pic and sometimes it freaks out on you, opens it big... Doesn't open at all... Opens and is blurry... Other then that it's just fine. Nothing to set a firework off for celebrating. Just, fine.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Amazing way to stay intouch with family and friends :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Still needs certain issues fixed such as certain search issues.. But overall it does the job..	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
The crashing is a biting and the search function takes a long while.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook is a huge part of my everyday life. Life wouldn't be the same without it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love being able to reconnect with old friends! It is so amazing how intertwined friendships are.BUT, it is so frustrating that I don't have a way to inform the developers when a feature is lost. Sometimes it's in an update, sometimes it seems to happen at random times.The locator feature is also inconsistent. Sometimes it has me located miles away from where I actually am located.Looks like the latest update fixed the crashes :-) It also seems to load faster. Finally I'm satisfied!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This no longer makes FB worth it on the iPhone. Updates are disappearing, feed  is showing promoted links instead of family updates. And the crashes...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
When I enter the Fb app, it doesn't crash until I reach the pages part. The pages app also crashes too when I try to write a post or see who liked the page. This bug needs to be fixed.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I don't like this update	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Actually the worst update!Unbelievable amount of lagging, crashing every 10 minutes, and driving me completely nuts!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It was running fine until I installed the so-called "update". Now it won't update statuses or my news feed. It runs slow and crashes ALOT. Quit updating it, you're running it into the ground. It should be called a down-date.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
All works fine here. Love the little bubble heads although I'm not a big chatter so they won't get used much.What's annoying is I sort my news feed on "Mist Recent" but when I share someone's post, it goes back to the top and changes to "News Feed" and it's proper doing my head in.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I like new format but hate all advertising and they still haven't lock up when try to upload an album of pictures. (It just freezes up. And I have super fast modem&service)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Nice	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This FB app could seriously not be any slower. It is a piece of junk on my iPhone 4. It takes forever to load and hides stories no matter which way I choose to display them. Def needs some work, very disappointing.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It keeps crashing, everytime I log on and reading post it crashes. I click on posts to comment and it crashes. Sort it now!! 	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
lucky to use the app for more than a second without it crashing.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Every time I open the app crashes! The new update was suppose to fix the bugs, but instead it made it worst...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Keeps crashing, really slow, says I have messages when I don't and it freezes	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Still can't refine the audience for posts and pics. It's often possible to read the 'share with' and 'hide from' options	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Works good! It gets rumors to flow!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I use this app more than any other. Doesn't crash for me ever	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It works fine on my iPhone 5	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Amazing app. Would like to delete or edit my posts is all (you can do it on the computer; no reason why you wouldn't here)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I like the app but it's always so slow....other then that I don't even use my PC anymore	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Crashes all the time!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
News feed seems to pick and choose what to display, have to constantly remind it to show most recent...and it takes a while to load even on wifi.Pics load slowly.If there was an alternative I'd try it but I fear this is as good as it gets right now	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Love the app.. Just wish the screen rotated when the phone is horizontal!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Stop the crashing and it'll Rick my socks.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Good app, still has a few bugs, mine often shuts itself down when I'm using it but overall a good app and does more than I expected from it	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
App is super slow and has a ton of glitches. Crashes at least 50% of the time that it's opened. There is no landscape mode which makes no sense. Only reason to have this app is because it seems to be the only choice.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good! But really needs sorting in some places! Whilst trying to upload pictures or send pictures it keeps throwing me out and I have to start again, which is extremely annoying!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Great idea and works ok just needs some areas sorted out like being able to delete things and how the app crashes some times can be frustrating!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I have had many problems with this app it crashes constantly and takes long periods of time to load  pictures statuses and video then there is the net work error when I'm at full bars ? What's up with that come on honestly this is app has become a terrible experience and we fans are disappointed corrects these problems please	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Like the added sharing options but don't like how the news feed changed.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's better but wish we were able to edit comments on app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashing every single time. Feels like to uninstall it forever!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
This version of the app totally shuts down every few minutes.  Please fix.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Facebook it stinks	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
A DISLIKE BUTTON FOR FACEBOOK!! You lost 2 stats for that!! HA	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is certainly getting there	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Finally, Facebook figured out how to make an app that works! I'm well-pleased. Thank you for helping me stay in touch with those I love.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
What did we ever do before Facebook?  Favorite app by far.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
News feed doesn't load properly with the latest update	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Sometimes photos can be uploaded and sometimes not. Sometimes my "most recent" stories were "just now" and sometimes they are from YESTERDAY!!! Extremely annoying. App seems to get worse with every update. Facebook works much better in Safari.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pretty good!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Updating my review. Taking away another star. Crashes when loading almost every first try. But what bugs me the most is how I like to view things by "most recent", and everytime I switch to that view (since it never seems to remember my preference), I get about 4 stories down and see a squiggly line break and it jumps to whatever I saw the last time I logged in - which could be from the day before! I've started using a web browser for Facebook instead of this stupid app. My previous review: Does what it's supposed to, I do like the app except it runs slow and takes forever for things to load.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
When are you guys going to give users the ability to use the Facebook app in landscape mode???????	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love it!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
It crashes, lags excessively, takes forever to update when I refresh and I'll get notifications telling me of a comment, likes or whatever, but I have to refresh the feed 2 or 3 times (if not more) to actually SEE the new comment. I've been using the Facebook app (for better or for worse) for 5 years, I think? And I would have to say this is definitely the worst it's ever been for me.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Perfect	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
This need to be fix,s more Like with the photos and everything and I and make better only for the iPhones more better plz	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Slow, unresponsive, crashes, buggy, error-prone. One would have thought that the billions of dollars that Facebook have they could have hired people who can actually program something.Too many adverts. Clumsy interface. Messages don't load properly.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I complain about it, but in reality, it is pretty darn good.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
No crashing, loads good, very fast, picture quality is great, no complaints :)	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still no landscape? Why is it I'm still not able to "easily" type my messages? And WTH is with these"chat heads"? Super annoying. The more you guys update this, the worse it gets... Why must I endure the same messages with chat heads as I do with the Messenger app?? Makes no sense	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I try to get on it bumps me off. I try to write a comment before you know it I'm back to all my apps. I try to change a profile pic and it puts up a pic I didn't want. I try to delete stuff and it just hides it. When I try to poke somebody it blocks them. It's like everything is backwards. It needs to be resigned and be used for awhile before the change.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I got 99 problems but Facebook ain't one!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I think facebook should have a DISLIKE button as well. And im not the only person alot of people on facebook who think so too. Please do it!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I love Facebook. I get to keep up with friends and family. It does not get much better then that.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
My App always seems to crash :(	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I appreciate what Facebook has done for past and present friendships; making it so much easier to keep in touch, etc. What I don't appreciate is the paranoia that what I put on FB can be so easily accessed by those who I've not "friended"...	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Constantly crashes, I have reopen the app and some times re-open it multiple times. It never stays on Most Recent for my Feeds and too many ads. When typing a status or chatting it slows or crashes. Also, why does it take forever to see your own status feeds, especially when you upload a pix?	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app has completely ceased functioning on my iPad. I have had to go to the web app on Safari full time. What happened? An authentication problem? If I delete the app and reinstall it works for a few minutes, then the "updating" symbol just spins forever but nothing happens.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app crashes a lot! Kicks you out constantly, it's not our device it's the app! The updates either fix the bug temporarily or they totally mess it up and temp I mean a couple of min or hours....	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
So you beg me to rate you and then take forever and a day to load so I can do it? Huh, alright. Well it's improved greatly within the last month I might say. The ability to delete comments, less lagginess and the new messaging features make it so much smoother to work with.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
The only thing I don't like about the app is that the timeline isn't in chronological order. It would be so much better if that could be fixed!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
So amazing...!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

I miss my blackberry when it comes to Facebook. This update is awful. The chat heads are stupid. And now I can't share posts on friends' timelines. Come on. People who are actually trying to promote their product actually work hard to make sure it's a good product. It's clear Facebook isn't trying.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Glitchy and crashes too often, but when it works it's an ok app. I wish you could edit your profile in more detail through the app though. You can't change your cover photo or a lot of other details in your profile. You should be able to interact with the iPad app exactly like a computer. Plus, I keep missing out on my friends bday announcements because they aren't shown in the app. As much $ as FB has at it's disposal, their app should be top-quality.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
If it's not crashing every five seconds, it's not Facebook! UGH!!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
A few times I log into the app it does not down load properly. This has been happening recently. Some old posts gets muddled up with new posts in the newsfeed and some pictures don't load properly and end up looking pixelated. These errors need to be looked over and fixed. But overall works fine.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Can't do anything on this app I have to go on Facebook via safari to do anything on Facebook plus its really slow !!!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Sheesh.  For the largest social network site on the planet, your ap blows. IF in can get this pos to even open at all, it eventually crashes almost immediately. Half the time or won't even open. Rather use my browser, and it even crashes that, too!   Crap!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Some slight problems with notifications not always showing up, but other than that there's no complaints!Wish they'd enable it so you can upload photos straight from the iPhone and tag people in it instead of just being able to show the location.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Hey guys! Let's give all our personal details to FB so they can sell them to advertisers and then shove advertisements down our throats! And let's do it voluntarily! While they accidentally leak our personal data on a regular basis!Facebook was great when it came out because it was all the stuff from MySpace that you liked and none of the annoying stuff. Since then though, slowly, it has become worse than MySpace ever was. THEN came the IPO. Now it's not even an experience. it is proverbially hooking up to a data IV so they can sell as much information about you to whomever wants to buy it.

Worst release ever, can't scroll, search or do anything, it crashes every time.  Reset iphone and still crashes.  Please hurry to fix that. Thx	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I have very little problems with my Facebook except that I will have to reload app most of the time to get on. Then during the use of the app it will freeze and I have to reload again. It also can be very slow at updating information.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's a great place to grieve regarding the loss of my sister & Dad recently. I can show pics of them & say how I feel @ that time. Friends can look & see, but if they r tired of me talking about it they can skip my post! Still a lot of network interruptions. Always room for improvement!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Definitely improving but now crashing constantly. Was working on a write-up post for our beagle page and almost done and it crashed on me. ***********************************************Another lousy update. I respond to something and it won't even show up. Each update the app seems to get worse, I waste too much time dealing with all the bugs in this app when I could just use the desktop on my phone and be done with these problems. Here is an updated review.  I changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars. Thanks for making it that when I'm in my news feed it doesn't force me back to the top, that was a huge fix!Ok here are my new complaints:1. Very slow loading time. 2. Can't view my pages I'm a fan of, just empty boxed when I go to look at them in the friends icon. 3. When people comment on your pictures 1/2 the time you can't see what they wrote, it just shows a + box to add a comment, even if there are 15 comments on the pic.4. Get an error message that won't let post on some of my friend's status or pics but I can from my desktop.5. THIS IS A BIG ONE - When you post on someone's wall and they respond you don't get a notice they did and you don't know unless you check their wall. 6. You can't tag people in your status. *********************************************1. You can't scroll through the news feed without it automatically resetting and going back to the top. 2. When people comment on your pictures 1/2 the time you can't see what they wrote, it just shows a + box to add a comment, even if there are 15 comments on the pic. 3. Get an error message that won't let post of my friend's status or pics but I can from my laptop.4. The app will turn grey and lock me out that I'll have to reset the entire phone to get app to work. 5. Several status updates don't even show up in the news feed; I'll see them when on my laptop. 6. When you post on someone's wall and they respond you don't get a notice they did and you don't know unless you check their wall. 7. You can't tag people in your status. 8. App closes down while in it.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Fb is good on the phone. The only thing I do not like is that I can not do some of the same things on the PC, since smartphones are mini pc now! Upset that it gets hung up or just click you out while strolling!	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Apparently, the world's most popular social networking site has decided that censorship is now appropriate. Allowing certain groups to bully others. I have really lost faith in what was once a fun way to share & stay connected.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The thing about Facebook is that you do need it because honestly in today's world is so hard to make those phone calls and make those text message; Staying in touch with everybody and without Facebook. It's a easy way to get that done, you do need this app ig you want to be in touch with everyone on a day to day everyday life. The The only one complaint I have is selected privacy and allowing certain people your images but I'm sure there's a way to figure it out this just needs to be more clear in the help center for that you don't get the last star but other than that: a  perfect app.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashes sometimes, but overall, I like the updates and such	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I love Facebook but it has some issues..I'm not getting my notifications at all and have checked my settings and they are correct, it likes to not load my pictures from my phone until the third time, and not I cannot find some apps I have on Facebook like status shuffle. Please fix these issues. Until these are fixed I'm only giving it 3 out of 5 stars.	1372143600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Please bring being able to manage your own personal photos by being able to delete photo if you want or need too. Always used be able to until updated Facebook app yesterday not a great idea you lose that. Otherwise I love Facebook it's a shame. Thank you so much for bringing back being abbÌ© to manage your own personal photo by being able to delete photo if want to or need too, this means lots love my facebook. Love this app so very much indeed on of the beat there is for sure. Just keeps better better and better all the time. I Love Facebook for sure.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

New updates make facebook on iPhone better than ever! I can now delete post from others that I  dont like or dont want to see and I like everything else. Great app! :)Three months later.

Good updates followed by bad ones.. Nothing is in chronological order anymore and u still can't copy and paste small lines of text.. Although u can now share and copy an paste a while status so that's something I guess and update cover pics is a good update.. I guess lol	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
1. The app is constantly crashing!2. The dates on messages sent are sometimes wrong.3. When I go on recent updates it comes up with 12 hours ago before like 5 minutes ago.4. The app is REALLY slow!!!!!!!!5. The order of the messages is very jumbled.. As a result the conversation doesn't make much sense! Things like this make me not want to be a Facebook user and make my smart phone useless! might as well go and buy a Nokia brick! at least I would be able to send a message without complications!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I am having to re-download the app since it keeps crashing. Not cool	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
New features with the update are great. Just some minor issues with the newsfeed not loading properly. When on 'most recent' still shows old posts up in the feed that shouldn't be there, also having trouble loading some pages that ends in the app crashing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
This app causes background activity every 5 minutes which drains battery rapidly and photo viewing is slow and unresponsive	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I'm using safari because this app won't load at all on my ip4. I don't get news feed, messages or anything! Even opening app from push notifications is broken. I hate this app, worse with every update!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Will not update news feed. Can only read notifications. There is ALWAYS something wrong with this app.I have to view Facebook on safari which is working fine!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Any chance of you testing updates before releasing them?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Hate the ads. Hate game requests. Love that you can now share things on other people's wall. Issues with posting comments still occurs occasionally. Overall it has improved a little however it has also gotten too commercial.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Facebook may have an outdated infrastructure at this point, and be more likely to mimic than innovate, but it's massive size makes it difficult to abandon. It's the only place to go to be able to share pictures and news with absolutely everyone. Just wish they would figure out that moving things around and copying their competition isn't the same thing as creating something new. If you want me to log on several times a day, you better find a new way to hook me, because ads for things I couldn't care less about peppering my news feed isn't doing it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Please continue to work on a few bugs here and there.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Loving this new version of Facebook for iPhone. I love how it now the option to put how you are feeling or what you are watching eating or reading. But when is going to support the new hash tag feature? Hopefully sometime soon.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Overall I like the app, my only concern is that sometimes the app doesn't update notifications, or doesn't load photos well, it might be the app, my connection, my provider, or even my phone, so I will only rate it 4 because of the errors which might be mine. Great app though!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Sloooooow, freezes up, too buggy to use. Is it because I'm still using ios 5 on an iPhone 4, or is the current update bad? I have just uninstalled.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's ok, it's just basic Facebook. Shame you can't change your profile picture or other important stuff but its ok.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

Does what I need it to do.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Haven't fixed the bugs at all. Try and type a long msg the app shuts down, you go back into it and it restarts and I have to write the msg again. A lot of problems with comments not appearing and likes not coming up. All in all nothing really has been fixed when it was supposed to. Only good thing is the new msg bubble and the feelings.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia

Navigating Facebook on an iphone is like surfing the web on dial-up: slow and unreliable. The app hangs and crashes more than it successfully launches. Most posts aren't displayed. Photos are blurry and don't fully load. Profiles don't fully load and it is impossible to upload a photo from the iphone. Chat is about the only feature still working. Notifications now happen every single time a friend does anything. It's about time for a complete overhaul and Facebook needs to rethink just about everything.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
slows and crashes even when I'm on it redesign please	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I will rate Facebook the same as I rate Coca-cola. Once a company becomes so ingrained in your daily life that it becomes almost automatic to use it or even call other products like it the same thing. How many times have you ordered a coke only to be ask is Pepsi ok? Sure it is ok as all you really wanted was a soda to drink. Hence Facebook is automatic, Facebook is a part of our daily life until a new, faster, easier, prettier, trendier Face-thingy comes along. We neither will love it nor hate it it will just become automatic.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

It's pretty useful. I like it. Except the fact that it keeps trying to make me allow it to do push updates of status updates.  I have enough things draining my battery and I don't believe Facebook is important enough to be allowed into my battery draining party.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This media site is an awesome place for positive interaction FOR ME. Yet there are a few things that truly disturb me. This site will suspend your account for sending out friend request to people you know, whether you have numerous mutual friends or zero. Speaking for myself I am not a stalker nor do I have stalker tendencies, I was truly offended but their actions. Also, I think it is not fair that some people must use their actual names without being allowed to use their title such as Rev. Min., etc. yet others can use crazy titles such as. "Mekahismainlady Norris" who named their child that. Finally, they will suspend your account for sending out "too many" friend request, but there is no way to prevent people from sending you unwanted game request, how unfair is that?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Great way to keep in touch family and friends	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love FB, I love connecting with my friends and family. I hate the lack of control re: how much I see. - This is exactly how I began my last review of FB and I still feel the exact same way. Though FB has made improvements to tagging and major improvements to use of FB on a mobile device, they are still lacking in a significant area: controlling what I see. Because of this, they lost a star rating from me. I am tired of having to click "most recent" to see everything (at least I assume it's everything) but then it's shows me things I have NO desire to see. I don't care about who everyone has become friends with, pages they've liked, and things they've commented on. I want to see ALL (not most or some) of the original ideas (posts, pictures, and status updates) from my friends and the pages I follow in the order they posted them. Is that so hard? I am beyond frustrated that I miss about half of the updates from the pages I follow; and when I click to look at just the pages I follow, it's not in chronological order. Really FB?? Chronological order - why would anyone not want to see things in chronological order? I makes no sense. Come on FB, I'm a big fan, but this is extremely frustrating.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I deleted the FB app this morning due to crashing and problems loading comments and pictures. I have an iPhone 5 but my wife is seeing the same on her 4.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not a big fan of the amount of times it crashes on me, but other than that, I'm addicted.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
iPhone 5. The app often loses the left hand menu to change between news feed, profile etc putting them in a banner at the bottom of the screen. Looks messy and only a delete and reinstall cures the problem until it reoccurs.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

On my last phone I kept trying to turn off push notifications, which mysteriously, turned on one day to no success. With my new iPhone, I have declined to turn on push notifications every time I've opened the app. Really FB? You're like a dog with a bone. Stop asking!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I love facebook but these latest updates are a pain in the rear end. All this app does is shut down. I love the new message heads and the stickers are charming, just get the bugs fixed that cause it to shut down and this app would be amazing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Newsfeed does NOT load correctly, no matter how many times I try to get it to show most recent items (I get 3 recent posts, then it jumps back to yesterday's). The app crashes all the time.

Timeline gets a bit muddled sometimes and you need the ability to delete your comments or others you don't like easier rather than deleting your whole post, apart from that its not too bad	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I like it lol	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
For about a week you had a nice little feature at the bottom of the screen that allowed you to go from one page directly back to your news feed, and you didn't have to scroll through the last 10 pages you had been on! That's gone! It's always going so slow and freezing!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nice to keep in touch whilst out and about but often crashes to home screen and runs slow on iPhone 3GS.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Overall, this version is not bad (remembering what we pay for it). A few changes to get used to, but okay. My only complaints are that it usually takes a couple of attempts to open the app, and it frequently just shuts down all by itself, seemingly saying, "Get off Facebook. You have been on long enough."  LOL	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's extremely slow... and it crashes... A lot	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I appreciate the way this allows me to keep in touch and see family and friends far away. Even in Europe.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Seriously, stop.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Nice app ever	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This time they made a good work	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love this app. I rarely have problems with crashing, or freezing. The app does what I want and I love each update. Keep up the nice work!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I am addicted to Facebook!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still closes for no reason and have to reopen again and again.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Slow and keeps on crashing. cant go an hour without it crashing. I expected more from a multi billion dollar company	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I hate the Facebook app like seriously I rather go back to the Internet to use Facebook . This app crashes way to much. When I'm scrolling down newsfeed, crash. When I'm looking at pictures,crash. As soon as I open it, crash. It's ridiculous. Can u please listen to the people and fix it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The most annoying app I've used and it keeps crashing! It does not load photos Or my wall, so whats the point??I hope they fix this problem bc I really liked this app and used it all the time! Now I can't use it at all #useless #app #facebookappsucks!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
LOVE FACEBOOK!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
You can use it to post and read statuses and all but it refuses to let you upload a picture to a specific album other than mobile. It has the option to, but it crashes when you try to. And it just crashes all the time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app is really good on iPhone 5 but it crashes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes almost every 5 mins ridiculous !	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
News feed wont update. It has updated 2x in the last few days. I have deleted and reinstalled a few times. iphone4	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
yo, i like this app.. & ima let you finish BUT i need to be able to UNFOLLOW POSTS from the app. i don't care for 32 notifications... when I've already said what i had to say. i need a "talk amongst yourselves" button or somethin'. thanks guy!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
App App keeps crashing when I'm uploading onto a page!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
SLOW and buggy. Like to crash. Still use it more than any other app I have	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am not getting any push notifications on 4s nor is my hubby on iPhone 5! All notifications are set up to facilitate push notifications but it doesn't work. Parts of conversation missing as well. Not happy	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Can't really complain about this app it helps me stay in contact with my friends and my girlfriend and family the only thing I don't like is it don't show some of my status besides that everything is awesome	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
More like broke, doesn't work on ipod4, don't download!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Not bad over all. Annoying when I have to wait to comment, uploads delayed and sometimes double of everything. But I don't pay for it so not bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Cannot link or like.  Just use FB on your laptop.  App constantly crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't seem to copy and paste correctly in the app when trying to copy a status. Something to look into. Thanks	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Whenever I go to Facebook, it crashes about 3 times before it finally goes to the newsfeed. Also, when I look at pictures, it crashes. Can someone please fix this annoying problem???	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I haven't had any issues with this app.  I like the ease of it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love Facebook but you should be able to change your cover photo on the app it annoys me so much!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I usually delay when click into picture .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's ok . But most of the time it's really slow .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Its not a big thing as much as it's not a small thing..it's an app plagued w/ problem that needs constant fixes & adjustments from time to time	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The updates are getting better for iPhone users. So far it's a good working app for me. I recommend it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This version is constantly crashes on my 4S. Never happen before in previous versions.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Landscape view will be nice	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes when i try to upload pictures! When in the chat crashes again! Getting tired to use it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Both Facebook and Facebook Pages have been crashing for no particular reason a few seconds after I open them as of today. I hope to the a corrected version soon.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It allows me basic Facebook functionality. If all those features worked all the time and it the most recent sort ever worked well, this would get more stars.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
My posts and comments constantly vanish so i must repost several times before it finally shows up. It never has post from friends I want to see but sponsored ads I could care less about. This happens on my iPhone 4 and ipad	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Use it every day! Would like a delete a post button though.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes all the time, I can't look at comments, and it won't even let me go to my home page, there is no sense in keeping it so I might as well delete it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's OK. I really wish we could use landscape in FB with an iPhone.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It won't let me upload my pictures into an album	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it great app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It is impossible to use without deleting and reinstalling the app.  This last update is causing all sorts of problems.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slow as molasses! I've abandoned the app, getting to FB via the web on my 4S.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
You'll like it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This "update" made FB SUPER SLOWit is awful. Who is Facebook to decide that I should only see news feed and not most recent?It takes forever to go to many pages and seems to serve FB and their advertising schemes better than those using it.Have also found conservative sites load slower and cannot be shared in some occasions. Update still slow.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
J'aime l'application et fonctionne trÌ¬s bien! 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

A crap update for a crap app!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Keeps crashing and waiting for bubble heads to always be available.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great site! Love it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I hate how fb doesn't stay in most recent mode anymore. Stories switch all around. Very annoying. When sharing something it goes back to the beginning and you have to start all over. Frustrating!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app doesn't open 90% of the time without having to have it open close and then open it again. I click on a name and nothing happens and it is posting everyone's comment 2-3 times it's stupid and I'm kinda fed up with Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Pero es muy lenta.  Bueno, la vida no es perfecta. But is too slow. Well, life is not perfect. Otro problema es cuando comparto alguna historia de un amigo, pÌÁgina etc, Facebook me envÌ_a de nuevo al principio de todas las noticias(timeline). Another problem is when you share a story of a friend, page, etc, Facebook sends me back to the beginning of all the news (timeline).	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's okay I don't love it I love God!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Works well!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Works fine, only issue is the app requires at least two reloads, it crashes and closes especially going app to app, it can't keep up.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
I hate the solicitation of apps & web sites I might b interested! Ur wasting my time!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Fun!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'd have given it a full five stars if you could change you're Timeline photo whilst using it.  Perhaps you could work on it for a future update??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It's great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love it it's awesome	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I do not get real time updates. In ability to delete groups or remove Facebook suggested groups is nonsense. The constant appearance of Facebook generated ads is not acceptable. Constant game requests or ad suggesting based off your martial status is bias and not acceptable... I really CANNOT stand the online dating suggestions constantly in my news feed ... The switching between groups in the feed is horrible	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's slow / unresponsive, keeps reverting back to Top Stories - why would I want to see things out of order? Why would I only want to see things YOU think I'm interested in? I can decide that for myself. How hard is it just to show posts in order? Every time you update it, it just gets worse...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Bug Central. What good is anything if you can't even turn it on properly? Too many changes just for the sake of being able to say you made some. Not easier. Not better. Want to improve something, routinize the process--like the ability to type in landscape on all pages. Half the time now I don't know what I can or can't do depending on the seemingly constant beta tests affecting me or my friends.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Always force closes -.-	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
When I leave a chat open and close the app and that person messages me and I open it to reply to them facebook freezes then crashes an I have to reopen it. Please fix this bug	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Too much sex and inappropriate behavior glorified on FB.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I love this app, don't get me wrong, but it keeps crashing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It crashes and then there is updates. Then something else doesn't work well. All in all it ok. It continues to get better over time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Good app could be slow at points but other than that really good app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Best one!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
The latest update has made it impossible to use. It take 4 minutes to look at any comments. So frustrated I am so close to closing my account!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Still crashing constantly. And the newest bit of frustration- if I share a link, it resets my news feed, messing with the organization and putting me back to the top of the screen. I don't need to see that my share went through, I want to be able to continue reading where I was without having to scroll back down 100 posts to find where I was.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nothin bad to say...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Slow, timeline updates aren't accurate.Must do better	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Shuts down often, frustrating because app usually closes as I am posting or messaging	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Once again we get an update that fixes one thing and stuffs up another. Fix the photo problem but it still crashes and every time you exit it goes back to the default "top stories" and you gotta start again. Let me look at what I want to look at Facebook don't try and tell me what to look at!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
There are so many things to criticize the developers of this app for, especially considering the millions upon millions of us who use it daily. The one main issue for me is the lack of a true editing feature available for text written and pictures added via mobile devices. The app does crash more than any other app I use as well. Can be quite frustrating, but its all we have to go with thus far!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It works.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Good when works - frustrating when using on mobile and find it does not show up some previous comments especially when people reply to your comments.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
You could do much better. It's alright.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I think Facebook is excellent - although the updates take time to get used to - they always end up being much more efficient :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
, I do not see any progress with the updates, with every update it seems to get worse.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I like this app and its easy to use. I only have two things that I can't stand. I don't how it is constantly slow to update and the new message bubble alerts when I open the app. Sometimes my most recent updates are from yesterday and I don't always want to read the mail in my inbox. Even if I just tap the bubble messages to see who wrote, it opens them up. This is just okay but in constant need of work.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Hate all the advertisements! I wish you would make the FarmVille game comparable with the iPad! I don't play FarmVille anymore because it isn't compatible. I am very happy that they keep up on the updates for Facebook!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app is great but needs to more in tune with most recent stuff in news feed because sometimes I got very old stuff in news feed but other than that it does what I need	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Muy bueno pero lÌÁstima que no se puede copiar y pegar casi nada	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app does not give you all the usual features so you have to log in on you computer to change any setting or subscribe to a page that you liked. It crashed a few times. It works for looking at your friends response posts. That's about it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
i have the ipad mini and when trying to update my news feeds it just wont update fix it and hurry up im not gonna be tolerating all this crap	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Shocking app, crashes every time I open it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I'm tired of the "suggested apps".  The same ones over, and over and over.  If I ignore it 15 times why does it keep popping up?  But on the other hand I never see posts that I have subscribed to or from friends. I like staying in touch with friends via Facebook so I guess I won't give up but it's definately gone 'big biz'	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Excellent the best app ever	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Apps don't work. Pages have been killed. What was the improvement?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Generally, a great app with loads of functionality. However, feel the latest UI isn't as user friendly as the last.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I dont mind facebook but i hate that i always have to hold my phone upright and cant use the landscape for viewing and commenting please fix! This is a pain! Also, since when does using facebook when not on wifi use up airtime?? It didnt before. Why now?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I'm ready to give up on Facebook.  The app doesn't load pictures or stories from more than an hour ago.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Its facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Couple of kinda cool features, attach a pic to a status update, message bubble.  Still hate the ads wedged in the wall. Like we don't get enough "suggested" pages already on the PC version. Figure out a better way to make money.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Not perfect but continual updates are making it better and better. What other app could you use?!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
what ever happened to landscape on FB ... bring it back. also, FB isn't allowing MyPhotos to post directly - have to go onto FB and post a pic through there.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love Facebook but this app still doesn't cut it compared to the mac/pc version.Not the same functionality or ease of use....needs seriously improving. C'mon guys!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
De app crashes all the time	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love this app it has worked awesome	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
i like facebook but , theres TOO MUCH DRAMA! whoes with me	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Freezes. Slow. I have had uninstall and re install 3 times. Some posts are being duplicated 2 to 3 times on my wall. No wonder it is slow. Not happy. Fix bugs!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
When ever I go onto someone else's page it goes of instantly When I log on it goes of and it takes about for time to come on It's slow I can't click on a picture of it will go of I'm on a iPod my brothers does. The same.You need to get some bug fixes I thing	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It can be allot fun when it works. The latest update makes it crash more often.  Also, now when I click on a link I end up having to start over at the top of the news feed EVERY SINGLE TIME!  The FB PC police are getting ridiculous. If somebody doesn't like a page then just unsubscribe to it.  It's to the point where I wish there was something like FB but without all the glitches or censorship.  When a good debate gets going I wish I could post pictures and emoticons.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
When the app works, it's great. But it crashes just as often as it works... The iPad version is even worse	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I love Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It won't upload my cover photos. I've tried repeatedly with the same head banging results. Please fix!! This last update is awful it made things worse instead of better. It's a sin because its a great app. If I could give half a star I would.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Please bring back the share option to public pages. I can't share things via mobile onto the page I run. Very important for my page, since there is constant news to update. Everything else is great.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's a necessary addiction :) but I wish it wouldn't crash so much :(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I LOVE this app! It's so user friendly, I love the new feelings I can add to my posts, the fact I can add pics to personal messages from my phone, EVERYTHING!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Total crap. It has about 10% of the functionality of even the mobile site. I often have to open it in Safari just to complete the most organic tasks. Every update brings more flash and useless features while decreasing its actual usefulness. Crap. 100% crap.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

To many changes bugs are still in the system. It crashes a lot. Have friends that are having the same issues. To many things released at once. Frustrating at times. Tells you that you have 10-17 new notifications but you only have 1-3 it's annoying. Social media page that's blown out of proportion	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App crashes too much plain and simple.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My app is working great! It hasn't crashed as much when I updated it. But it still has a couple bugs	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook is cool you get to talk and meet people that you wouldn't talk or see in your life time....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Never crashes, and works like it should. Could Facebook in itself be better? Yes. But the app seems to work fine for what you need. So I give it a thumbs up!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I can no longer press on a photo in my group and share it with this version!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Terrible. App crashes all the time. Especially when I click a picture. Freezes and the crashes. The bubble talk is stupid. It slows the loading by a lot. Just stick to messenger and two clicks to actually go to messages. What's the point of a sore update if you keep adding stupid, and unnecessary, updates? Stick to the basics.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever since the update I've noticed that when I'm talking to people in chat, some of the messages that it says I receive via push notifications won 't actually show up when I open the app, then when I go onto my laptop they'll be there. And my news feed is also slightly wrecked because it won't refresh anymore and I've been stuck with the same posts on it for over 3  days now. The only way that it will actually refresh my news feed is if I delete and re-download the app. Please fix these bugs with the next update.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
I like Facebook but lately it's been locking up.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I had this app then deleted it for a few weeks because I was too frustrated with how it kept freezing when I'd type. I checked the App Store- oh it had been updated recently! So I re downloaded it and it still freezes from time to time but crashes a lot less. Still not the most enjoyable experience but better I suppose! Lol	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Usually the app updates are great but the last one with the NewsFeed details - not so good. But love how you listen to our feedback and get it right most of the time. Thanks	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia

The things a like are that it's convenient, but it can be slow and it crashes often. Doesn't always open up picture files and responds slowly at times....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
ALSO CAUGHT UP WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like the app but can't keep up with the constant changes!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It is a good app 5 Starr's	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's ok but i really need to control privacy on each post, more than the limited options FB provided. Like to the specific people that i DON'T want my post to be seen.  And please stop crashing!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
They should fix the problem that I go in the app and it just exits out and when you go on search the friend and like buttons are to small and the whole thing is super slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Good way to keep in contact with family and friends!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Works way better on my iPhone 5 than it did on my droid!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes. Frequently. Still crashes...frequently.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Since its the only fb app available, we've got to deal, but every update seems to big it down so much more. What gives developers? Huh? What gives?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Enjoyable	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It keep crashing and freezing on both my iPad and iPad Mini.  Stop with the Suggested posts and all the other superfluous junk you post on our news feeds!  It is very slow! Do something to fix these bugs   All are very annoying!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I enjoy this app a lot. It has it's burps, but thankful I'm not expecting it to be perfect running like it does when I'm on the computer. So for it being on my phone I get a lot of enjoyment from it & the burps are minor.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Updates have helped. Need an option to post directly to someone's wall and tag people when posting items from news sites/apps. Still freezes and crashes often.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Since update crashing seems to have stopped! Still slow though and often displays posts out of order. Images also dont display well and take ages to open ---> old version: Crash crash crash, have to open it twice every time and it doesnt always have recent posts. Has slowed down with recent 'upgrades', and the ads are getting worse. Good enough for basic use if you are patient!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Everything I need	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Very disappointed. Cannot switch to "landscape" on main page. Sometimes the app freezes. Sometimes, while using Facebook, it'll all of a sudden close. Mark Zuckerberg, lets get with the program and stop making new layouts. FIX THE BUGS!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like it easy n fun	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The latest update stinks.  Several bugs. Sluggish and slow.  Freezes when opening pics and sometimes crashes all together. I can't believe this has not been fixed, very frustrating. Also still not seeing all my friends in the feed.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
My description said it all!!! Crashes and freeze all the time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Since last update it hasn't worked on my I phone 4s	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Love it. Need to stop making changes to it. It is how I keep up with all my family. Love it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes 3 times before it finally opens. I won't even touch pictures anymore, if the app doesn't crash first, it will freeze for a while before the picture loads. Doesn't update to show when I put a status, if it does show up it comes up twice. Get it together Facebook. This app used to run so smoothly. No one needed hash tags, you have more important things to worry about.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If you want users to stay or even new users, it would be in your company's best interest to fix the many bugs this app is infested with. I open app, see news feed, start to scroll down, CRASH! If I get past news feed to look at my own profile, CRASH! More than fingers and toes I attempt to open app, CRASH! I'm sure you pay tech support team a good salary, it's time they do their job or begin to hand out pink slips... Sincerely, a very disappointed user.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Maker me get contact with the world happy to have it Thank you Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes and closes all the time, seems to do it after using it for long periods of time, ten minutes or so. Not bad besides that.,,.like that you can use text symbols now	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love Facebook....connecting and staying in touch with friends and family. Up to date on events. The ability to reach a multitude of people with one post.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Honestly has both ruined and fixed my life multiple times. I know this sounds like a bad review but I assure you it is not. There are people I would not have gotten back in contact with that I love dearly if it was not for Facebook. Facebook is great:)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Awesom	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
6/23/2013 The Facebook icon cannot count.  It says 16 notifications, you find 3, etc.  Other than being asked rotate every little change, it is a decent app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I Ike the look and feel ... There are still some adjustments needed ... Should have a way to switch from page owner to self	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I like the previous version much better. I don't have any crashing problems, but it is to easy to get into the notifications mode if you are typing down or scrolling down, but thanks for letting me give you my opinion and for letting me stay in touch with the people I love.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The FB app is CONSTANTLY crashing and freezing.  You'd think a conglomerate like Apple would make a very popular app a little less wonky, but instead this app crashes on me almost every single day.  Same with the iPhone FB app.  Crashbook... The Facebook app from Apple.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Defiantly better on PC where it's fully functional , still a great way to communicate with family and friends that are far away	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
its ok when it dont play up :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Since the last update I can't use the app on my iPhone or IPad, it opens but the newsfeed never updates. It will show I have a new notification but I can't get to it. Worthless.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So far, no crashing issues.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have been having a problem when posting, my post doesn't show up on the first try? It will on the second time around, after I have to rewrite it. If its a lengthy post, it gets very annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes every couple of minuets when I'm trying to type messages	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Used to love this app.  Can't get it to work after the last update.  Open n close.  Restart iPad.  Even deleted it from iPad and downloaded again.  Nothing seems to work.  What happened to this app??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Quirky and ever-changing, but what's the alternative? Also feel bullied into rating this to stop the pop-up in app requests.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Feel like typing anything in Facebook? Forget it. It will crash on your every single time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is incredibly slow for me!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If you are a regular FB user you will find this convenient.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's awesome!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This is now the worst app on my iPhone !! Fix this or I'm leaving.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I absolutely love Facebook! I guess you can say, I'm a "Facebook addict."  The only thing I would like to change, is that you can update your cover photo from a mobile device. It's a pain to go on the desktop to do it. All of my friends agree! Love Facebook(:	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I just wish they could get the feed to update correctly, it's all over the place out of order, never updates with comments and likes. I do like the layout much better now.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Ever since the new update my app on my phone nor my iPad works. It doesn't load.  In fact it's still showing me posts from 3 days ago.  I have to go to the Internet to check my notifications. Craptastic update FB!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The sub-categories for friends, on the left side panel, have disappeared. Replaced with many useless options.Now you have to awkwardly scroll down through the general newsfeed to access these sub-categories. Stupid, stupid update removing an easily accessible option.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Good job with being able to do more of the desktop features but still crashes on me. I even had my phone checked to see if something was wrong with my touch screen bc this app never responds to the "tapping," and if it does it takes forever. Still with every update it crashes almost always when I go to look at pictures.  Sorry Facebook still getting 2 stars from me.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not sure what all the complaint is about. I've been using this app and all it's different versions for about 3 years now, and the app is working just fine for me, and no I don't own any Facebook stocks I don't make enough money to invest in any company. My wife and I both use this app on the iPhone 3G, and now on the iPhone 4S with no problems. The only thing I'm not happy with is the fact that the people at Facebook do not believe in the 1st amendment unless it favors the Liberals.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have to click the app at least three times before it opens, when it does open I see one persons status two or three times, I can't like or comment on anything and it will only show me a few of the most recent statuses or page feeds until it goes to the previous day. Uninstalling, not worth the aggravation.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Added more stuff. Still crashes occasionally, mainly when going on my wall using this app when i've updated stuff before hand on the web. Runs faster as well. But no most recent fix. Goes from 35 minutes ago to 7 hours ago with nothing inbetween :/	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Everything is good	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

I love being connected to family and friends, especially those I cannot see often! I am finding it more difficult to use since I updated. I don't see birthday notices like I used to.  I cannot delete posts if I want to.  I get kicked out a lot! It often won't let me send messages (won't accept the addressee)...annoying!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

It would be great if you could turn the phone sideways and use the keyboard.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I don't seem to have the issues others have with the app my app works just fine. I don't have to reopen the app a bunch of times to get it to work. It could be wireless connection for some people.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It tends to freeze sometimes and goes to home screen	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Awesome app. Very fast on the new iOS. Simply amazing	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Slow, slow, slow. It freezes, takes an age to connect. Notifications repeated, messages that aren't there. Since making this App more complex, it has become almost unuseable. It seems those in charge at Facebook never listen, don't like feedback and strive to make things harder. Now they have floated, money seems to be the incentive. The chat bubbles are annoying and the whole app hangs forever! Poor show FB.... but what option have we......?	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I had little issues before the update. Now, it crashes every 2 minutes, at least. It lags and loads things multiple times as if it isn't responding to itself. Before you fix this, which you severely should, triple check with a control group to make sure it works.Sincerely,Everyone	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Well Facebook you have done it again, its started crashing again, the comments are slow to unresponsive, oh and the iPhone version is damn near unusable now because you can't change from 'most popular' FB I WILL CHOSE WHICH POSTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME NOT YOU!!but at least (irony warning) it look pretty!So now the share button by default doesn't let you edit! What is going on. They actually fixed something! The share button gives you a choice again. Too many adverts and a small mountain of you might like spam for random pages. It's started crashing again on pictures. Not as random as before but still not good.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Downfalls are the pictures- can't tag, download/save, make a picture your profile default and timeline default. Fix this. Crashes a lot, too. I do not receive notifications when I receive personal messages, and even regular notifications are postponed.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app runs perfectly fine.  I'm assuming the ones with the problems are running it on an older iPhone maybe?  The only thing I wish they had was landscape mode.  Other than that, the app runs smooth.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Seems to be working just fine for my 4s. No complaints.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Ever since adding all the options of what list to view, it randomly switches to different lists making you miss posts you want to see. News feed frequently displays out of order and needs to be refreshed repeatedly to get all posts back. Hate it, put it back.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Constantly refreshes and when I try to scroll down it just shoots back to the top. Not to mention that it make every post three times in a row and usually doesn't let me interact with any post. This new update was a horrible move on facebooks part. They launched it too early and should have worked out the kinks before releasing. Make me think less of Facebook now.

It keeps crashing!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Yeah, mine does crash. Not on startup, but when I look at pictures it does. If it doesn't crash when I look at a picture, it is extremely laggy. Also, when I want to share something, it won't do it. I waited 5+ mins for something to be shared and it didn't load one bit. Another thing is comments. I want to look at comments for something, nope. Just that spinning loading wheel for another 5+ mins.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like it	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
I can't click on photos without having it freeze. It's quite annoying.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I gave this app 1 star because it continually crashes on my iPhone 4, it takes a really long time to load and quite frankly, it's just really annoying. Sorry:/	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App is great when it works but it is becoming increasing unresponsive, slow and crashes constantly. Please fix these issues and you have a winner!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

The absolute worst app you can ever have on your ipad/iphone , this thing crashes more than Amy winehouse on the carpool lane on a day she began with vodka instead of coffee.And to add up it has the ultimate worst browser!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Worst app ever. DONT GET IT.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The Facebook app has always been a bit glitchy but the last couple of updates have brought much more frequent crashing and hanging. Time they revamped this sucker completely - or revert to the original version. Very frustrating.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Crashes, freezes, takes forever to open. Can not keep it on most recent and every time I share something it goes back to the top and reloads. Easier to just go online to use Facebook.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Why does Facebook always think they need to update things that work just fine? The new IM circle thing is totally un-needed, the new top status bar letting you know someone commented , liked , or whatever your post is already done when there is a new on the globe. Please change it back! I am to the Point where Facebook may no longer be on my cell.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
All it wants to do is crash.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

For a company who brags so much about how many people are on it, and their ads, why, and who have they hired to do this app? It crashes, doesn't load, runs slower than a snail in water.   This last update has more tech issues than an old radio.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Whoever developed this obviously didn't care enough to try. I give it two stars only because it does what I need it to. Other than that you should probably use the browser.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
A lots of updates and the crashes still the same :/	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time they update it it gets worse and worse. "Most recent" is suppose to mean minutes or hours ago not days or weeks ago!!!! I don't know why you ask us rate because y'all aren't taking anyone's advice so stop asking for a rating because you will always get 1 star and that's only cause the App Store requires it or else I'd give no stars at all.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am not overly impressed, I write a comment & it doesn't appear so I write it again & then there are 2! Fix this dang ap!Why doesn't all the posts come thru on this ap?

This app freezes all the time, takes forever to load/refresh, and why can't we view the app in landscape format? I appreciate the changes that have been made to it thus far, but how come there is hardly any difference to the speed and quality of the app?	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ever since they started showing everyone what people like and comment on, it's been getting very very messy... Isn't that what sharing is for? I never see posts from my friends anymore, just pages that other people like and comment on...	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook still can't get it through their numb skulls that there are those of us that really do want to see most if not all of our friends' posts, and continue to throw hoops and hurdles at those that attempt to read everything. I can't tell which of the options I'm supposed to set my news feed to in order to see all of the posts. I can set it to "All Friends" or "Most Recent" or any of the other options, and in each setting I see posts that I don't see in the others. Very frustrating for people that use FB to keep in touch with their friends. Also, the new Messages thing where you see their face in a little bubble is dopey. They should just set it back to the way it was in the previous version. Otherwise, the app is stable and works well.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Create a feature where we can chooses if we want our friends too see what we like and comment on please. Facebook is too public!!! I know I'm not the only one.

Quit trying to add features! You can't even get the old ones right. Newsfeed is mixed up. "Most recent" button doesn't work. Crashes. Slow. I wish I could quit you, Facebook, but I'm addicted. This app is the worst one I use. Zero stars!!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ever since I have updated the Facebook app I haven't had any problems except for it being kind of slow but it was worse before I updated it cause I would open it and its load then go back to my homepage and I had to reopen it over and over again I guess I don't highly recommend it unless your a patient person unlike me.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I find it to be very slow on many different avenues. It's always crashing, takes way to long to open up pages, downloading is just flat out frustrating!! Also it's turned into way to much advertising and seeing pics of suffering, ill baby pics is not what I wanna see. I want to see what my friends and family are up to not adds. As soon as you like something then your flooded with commercial like garbage. Facebook needs to start over from scratch. Another thing is that as soon as I start getting to like it again it changes once again. It needs to speed up...	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Since the upgrade it shuts down first before it lets me open it a second time. And pretty annoyed that it no longer hides all pieces of info I want. Even spending 2 hours on privacy setting it lets my timeline be public to everyone. The former version did not. I wish they would stop updating it because w each update it gets less and less secure for user.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The sort button on my iPhone Facebook continuously disappears.  Then when you choose which way you want to sort, the app changes it back to the opposite way.  Pages take a minute+ to load even when I am home and on my wifi.  The app constantly closes and posts do not show-they disappear after hitting post.  You cannot search on group pages like you can on a PC.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

When opening the app on iPhone 4 it crashes a good 6-7 times before it finally opens up. Opening/viewing pictures/picture posts it takes a really long time and often crashes or gets "stuck" in the corner of the screen with only a corner of the pictures available to see. Very glitchy. Also chat isn't showing any names at all. Had to dL another app just for chat. :/ love Facebook, need a revised app tho..	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app drives me insane. It randomly spazzes out and closes almost every time I use it. It's so hard to be patient when you have been typing for 5 minutes and then you lose everything you typed! In addition, the Spazbook app has a hard time viewing photos. PLEASE DO US ALL A FAVOR AND FIX THE APPLICATION INSTEAD OF ADDING USELESS FEATURES TO IT!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Any time I consider opening this app, I have to consider whether I'm in the mood to be irritated or not. It is by far the most sluggish app on my iPhone. When it takes up to 20 seconds for each new page to load fully on a fast wifi connection, you need to revisit the way your app is written.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

It is a good, stable app for the most part but unfortunately it does just close or crash on me pretty regularly.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Looooove it!!! Especially because I'm able to find friends from jr high, high school & family in Mexico that I haven't talked to in years!!! 	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

The app is not how it used to be like for some pages you don't have posts by others, what the point of removing it? Most of us don't have a desktop to view these pages we like Etc Even the notifications show up all the time, please fix it ASAP, you guys have all the time and money in the world to rectify these issues	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Facebook para mi es vivir la vida del dia a dia muy util para toda la sociedad humana ya que ase todo practico en las redes  ciberneticas,, lo califico con un 10	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
App crashes SEVERAL times before it loads...and will lock up and crash frequently even once it opens. App will also not always post what I want or will freeze, etc. If I post to a group I admin most of my posts don't go where they're supposed to. App is extremely slow and unreliable at best...and fb expects me to add additional apps of theirs so i can admin my pages from my phone?! (fat chance btw) Definitely NOT worth the time/energy to download and install. Epic fail fb!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very slow, hangs and crashes often. Stop releasing new features and please fix the performance!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Great app only thing I wish would change back is to where you could change your privacy setting to where only friends could message you.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can't say it's perfect as then there would be nothing to work on to make it even better .... But all seems good :-)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Muy buena	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
To be honest, I prefer the old version. I'm used to typing sideways and viewing the pictures the normal way....now the pictures disappear when I slide down which gets on my nerves. And when starting the app, which crashes atleast 3 times before starting, takes forever to load my newsfeed or it shows posts from days ago and I have to completely close the app and reopen it again for the 3 times and then it will fix for a short period of time -.-"	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app is too unstable it crashes a lot	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I think there should be a option to turn your web cam on and live stream a chat room on your profile page. So we can connect with friends & family.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Just updated the app. Cannot login on any of my mobile devices, keeps coming up incorrect user name or password. Please fix.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

App crashes more then the last version.  when I click to see a pic it crashes. Then it's all laggy when you're trying to do something on it.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It never fails that every single time I open Facebook it crashes immediately and then I re open the app and it runs for a couple minutes then I click on something to comment or enlarge a photo and bam your app crashes. Ive uninstalled many times and now I am resorting to using a app that supports Facebook other than Facebook. Pretty pathetic. Fix it and you'll get 5 stars again	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Whenever i click on the app it crashes like 3 times before i can veiw it n then whenever im on someones profile it crashes you needa fix this bc right now between fb, instagram, and twitter i would put fb in third place n the sad thang is that i dont have a twitter n i very rarely use my instagram but ik they work better than this app so please fix it. Thanks	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Please put the 'most recent' setting in the settings on the left hand tool bar as previous, this new drop down format just isn't working!Also starting to get lots of problems when trying to reload with stories and posts missing on my news thread.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I dislike Facebook's algorithm for determining what is top news. No problem I can ask the app to sort by most recent. Oh that is right, I can't. Why did you remove that feature from app? Bring it back.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is always crashing .. Also on some people's wall I have to go to my browser to post on their wall because the app won't let me.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Just downloaded the latest version today(6/23/13). I hate this version! Why can't it just show me all the newsfeeds? I have to click on friends, follows, or category of people separately. What a pain! All my likes don't show up. When I add photos, it doesn't show that it's an album and only 7/20 are able to be viewed from the newsfeed. You have to go into albums and then be able to see all the photos. And those are just the glitches I've been able to find from using it for two hours!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It is really good	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
turned into a disgusting site	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Love it. Would be nice if it didn't automatically put you back on just regular news feed after posting something or sharing it if your on most recent though.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Facebook is an awesome site to communicate, share pictures, and even play games!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's amazing how quickly (relatively speaking) Facebook has woven its way into society.  It helps me keep in touch with many people and stores and organizations.  It does crash occasionally but less than before.  Is there a spell check feature?  There are so many features I haven't explored.  Keep improving, but don't leave people with older equipment in the dust.  It would help if you would begin labeling new updates to apps for whatever version of FB it will work with.  Technology is improving faster than the hardware.  So the day will come, too quickly, that new updates will be unavailable to many depending on what version of FB a customer is running.In any case, overall I love using Facebook.  Keep up the good work yet keep it people (and pet) friendly.  And I do love the cat and pet photos as long as they're shared with proper credit (if I can figure out!)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

If it had not been for FaceBook, I would never have had the opportunity to meet my Fathers side of the family. It enabled me to slowly get to know each one a little before I made a trip to meet them in person. I am very grateful for that.

Since loading this last app it's rendered my Facebook as very nearly useless, nothing appears for up to 24 hrs & pictures do not appear at all! The only way to make a slight improvement is to shut down phone & then restart it. Review ????? Bloody rubbish !	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I've been getting a ton of sponsored ads from other countries that aren't even in a language I can read. I've stopped using the Facebook app because I'm sick of all of the sponsored posts which just add to how long it takes to load, the fact that it won't update (I can check and then check again in two or three hours but it still thinks a status I saw three hours ago is 18 minutes old) and I'm sick of restarting the app a few times a day.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Its good enough. Sometimes crashes but not enough for 1 star but not good enough for 5	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

The new Facebook upgrade or whatever is really making me angry. I deleted this app at least 3 times because my friends were constantly going through my things. Also, the app is extremely slow.

I can't make sense of the newsfeed filters. They seem redundant and often show me completely different posts than my computer, omitting many. The message bubble is annoying and impossible to shut off. Also, the biggest issue is that it drains my battery.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I'm liking the newest update my only issue is it loads a little slowly. I'd like an option where I don't have to see what my friends are liking and only see there status and uploaded pictures but other than loading speed no complaints so far.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Not bad. Could be more straightforward about privacy though. But better than anything else out there. And there's not much else out there so that's the best you can get until something better comes along. But the new chatheads is actually Chathead as you only get one and for the most part it's lame. Just waiting for something better to come along.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

iPhone app crashes a lot. Will lockup where phone needs to be rebooted. Apps should be tested more for problems before releasing.

I think it is really good that now every time I want to go onto Facebook with this app I have to completely delete it from my phone and reload. Given that I use it as a business promotion tool as well as for keeping up with friends this is a number of times per day. This great development ensures I get just a bit frustrated every time I use the app. If this was your intention you have done well. If not, then this is not a good upgrade!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Okay so finally Facebook have rewritten the app from the ground up in object-C instead of HTML5 - that's what causes the slowness of the last version it had to constantly refresh. the new app is now native with the iPhone and should now perform faster on a whole.To highlight some of the previous reviewers concerns about the app, you can easily delete a post or hide it from your "timeline" by swiping left from the far right of your screen.Also to save pictures just press and hold on the desired picture and a menus will pop up giving you the option of saving or making it your profile picture.Just wanted to make sure that this app is being reviewed as a whole experience and for me it does the trick and is allot better than any past versions. Try it out and see for yourself!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It crashes and slows down at least 2 to 3 times a day.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook creates cracks in people's lives . With bad comments from individuals . Which causes wars and conflicts around the world .And the Facebook gets worrying monitored by the government s. how stupid do u think people are.And it's doesn't not work very good the iPhone app.So well done Facebook and well done to iTunes for letting FB and FBI have the privileges	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
App is extremely slow crushes too much rarely works fine. Hate it	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I really like the recent updates, I'm hoping we get a new look with the new iOS 7 interphase coming out.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love this app, thanks to the inventor! Thanks to Facebook, got to find my family even family I didn't even know and old and new friend in one single place! Thanks again!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app is really really slow and logs me out most of the time!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still crashes a lot. Easier to upload stuff. Seems more targeted ads and less friends status updates.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The update before this one was great, fixed a lot of the photo loading problems and it ran real smooth. This update won't load from the get go, and I have deleted and reinstalled it. This is terrible. If its not broken, don't fix it!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

It loads pretty fast so no real complaints.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Seriously, I've review the app three times now and getting annoyed!!!Great app and more room for improvement though I use it as mug as the next person :)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Stepping backwards! Posts are jumbled even when I select 'most recent'Notifications are inconsistent, one day I get one asking me to wish happy birthday to a friend and Another day it won't even appear on my pull down menu, there is more detail however	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Keeps freezing and crashing - losing unsaved data	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Your app keeps getting worse and worse. I don't car about "news feed" I want to see everything chronologically all the time, and u constantly change this for me, and ur app has gotta a lot slower as well, feel like a huge roll back would be better then trying to fix issues :/	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook owns your soul now and has sold it to the highest bidder!Look forward to more cold calling and email spamming	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Luv it	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Well, with all th unwanted "improvement" you'd think that the FB staff would listen to suggestions; it doesn't!One thing that is drastically needed for the iPad is to keep the navigation bar visible as we scroll through the News and Timeline pages. A whole lot of us have asked for this yet nothing has been done.Another thing, it would be nice if we could EDIT our posts from pads and phones. Between automatic spell checking and finger-farts there is often a need for an edit!Minus one star:I never liked "[Facebook] might post for you without your knowledge" that is required by most of its apps! There should be an "Opt In" with the default being "Opt Out."Minus one star:The new Timeline look. Like posting without my knowledge, this should be an Opt In thing. There was nothing wrong with the old look, this was jammed down our throats in a move reminiscent of Microsoftesque and MS's Big Brother knows best marketing attitude.One more screwy idea and its So long Facebook!Why is it FB can make pages where the navigation panes on the side are tied to the main page which makes you have to scroll all the way back to the top after you have finished reading new posts?	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I am having problems with my Like button , when i tap the Like button it keeps going out .. I told you the problem 3 times and still having problem . Fix it please !!' Why does it keep skipping on me ? Plus it keep crashing !!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I can't even get this app to update it crashes before its finished! It's horrible! I thought my kindle fire apps was bad, hah it has nothing on this app!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not bad, something's could be easier to do on mobile ie editing posts,deleting pics.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Doesn't update properly or play any sounds on notifications and it hangs there for a long time when loading most recent news, does not show recent comments I do not like this app, I don't want a website inside a app I just want basic communications, the app is needlessly bloated beyond belief and its causing a lot of bugs	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Very good and easy to use app	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It's getting better after each update but PLEASE sort out that annoying picture view out. It cuts out the edges of the photo, then when you zoom out 2 seconds later it zooms back in and you can't see half the picture. Please sort it.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

Get rid of the stupid message bubbles, keep just so the notification stays in the inbox icon, its really bad.Also the comments on posts is so unreliable, gets a notification saying that they have commented yet i refresh the page a billion times and there still is no new comments.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It's ok but can be better slow as hell but works some times but happy can go on Facebook where ever thanks	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Facebook has now been installing for 2 days and will not respond.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Keep doing what you're doing Mark	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Chat heads are annoying - another type of notification is distracting and useless... A black bar now covers the notification bar and you have to hide both now.. Keep it simple please!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Although the layout and everything is great. It continually closes down on you. Every few minutes the app will close and won't let you in for a minute or so. Has been doing this the past few updates.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

great app!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Been very happy with the updates to this app. One thing I'm still looking for is the ability to turn my phone sideways and type with a wider screen. I would think that update would have been top of the list.  Recent updates take you back to the top of the page once you share something.  This is extremely annoying.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashes a lot Very slowSeldom updates automatically Please fix Or put it back the way it was	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Works well but could be better. Seems to be slow loading new newsfeed items.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	New Zealand
Does not work. Will not refresh. Only way to get up to date news is by deleting and reinstalling the app. Fb contacted 2 days ago and nothing. Get it fixed!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Keeps crashing all the time and exiting out of the app randomly while uploading a picture or watching a video. So frustrating !	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	New Zealand
App works well but wish you were able to change your cover photo on the iPad version like you can on the iPhone version.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashes too much, it is slow, sometimes you don't get notifications about anything and it can be almost impossible to post something	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is always improving.  There is not many phone apps that are as user friendly as their website.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Wonderful invention!.....wonderful, the best social media ever!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
PLEASE STOP WITH THE NEW UPDATES!!!!! Facebook was fine at first you need to stop making new updates you are ruining facebook it was fine at first but u just messed up the app with all these unnecessary updates -.-	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Perfect	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app could be so much better and feature enriched but its just so so. App crashes on a regular basis. For as huge as Facebook is and as much money as they have I would have expected something a lot better than this.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
A recent update improved the terrible crashing I was experiencing on I-phone. But the app is still slow to load. I still hope to upgrade it to 5 stars someday.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Facebook more interested in pushing its adverts, then fixing its app, shows JUST NOW from hours ago, crap.. also you can't block adverts it sends you :(	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Annoying how it doesn't automatically show most recent posts and doesn't display all posts. Have to resort to my laptop if I want to see everything.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	New Zealand
My only complaint is that I don't see where you can view most recent.  Posts are all over the place!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
OH DEAR! They finally nailed a great app only to release a bug riddled update to kill it off again. Do they test apps before release at Facebook???Sort it!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
It's good :)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Works great but the notification numbers need work. I'll get one thing but it'll say 5 or 6 new notifications. Other then that it works fine.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Keeps crashing very annoying pictures won't open properly or stay open. Im fed up and irritated. Please sort it out FAST Crash Crash Crash Crash Crash Crash	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The new version crashes a lot. Why doesn't the iPad version match the iPhone version?  I hate the minimalist Timeline. Bring us the full cover capability.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I never should have upgraded to this version.  I have uninstall and reinstall the app to get my newsfeed to update. Likewise pics don't load and I can't view or leave comments on anything with a pic.  This app is utterly useless.  I cannot fathom how something that performs so poorly was ever approved for release.  If I could rate it Negative 5 stars I would.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is literally my most unreliable and frustrating app. It is jerky, it takes an age to display pictures, it closes unexpectedly, for no apparent reason. I hate it, and in my opinion, it needs a lot of work, considering people rely so heavily on social media, via portable devices nowadays.Get it sorted people	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Normally I wouldn't take the time to write a review for a mediocre app. But this time the Facebook app update is so TERRIBLE it can't be helped.Isn't there a way to downgrade?!Since updating a few days ago, the app can't manage to go five minutes without crashing. Complete incompetence. How does a company as successful as this produce software as terrible as this?If you haven't upgraded yet, save yourself repeated headaches and avoid it until they fix the crashing problem.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
En mi iPhone 5 no suenan las notificaciones!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
this is the worst update of Facebook ever. it crashes all the time. stop focusing on the littlest things on the web version.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I like it.You need to add A save button	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The force close issue seems to be at a minimum now and I like the emoticons That you can include in your posts. Overall a decent app.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
So slow, crashes 90% of the time just when opening the app! The updates are too complex for my iPhone 4 and I refuse to upgrade my phone just to make it compatible with Facebook! Really needs fixing. So frustrating!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Always crash what happen	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I dont have any problem so far with my iphone 4. I like it ;)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I don't understand how Facebook is one of the biggest social networking sites yet the the app version cannot go well without it having to crash every 3 minutes.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Very good app and easy to use.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Crashes sometimes	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The notifications are poor. The home screen notifications don't cancel out when you go to the post before you cancel out. It says there's a notification then you click on it and it takes forever to update before you get to the notification. Annoying.... It's not easy to get back to the beginning of the news feed...have to hit the back button 10 times sometimes to get there.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It crashes a lot. It takes an extreme amount of time to load multiple pictures. When I tap on a picture or comment it takes forever to pop up or it crashes. I experience more crashes than anything. Sometimes I can't like a picture or status. It's very frustrating! Get it together!!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not too bad an app.It should have the same features and abilities as the original online web based app. for it to deserve an extra star.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I'm happy in the apps, now working nice	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Where would we all be without the Facebook!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It works	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I still cant delete tags or photos or posts on the mobile app and now when I want to take a screen shot of a pic, I cant resize it and have it stay that way. Whenever I tap the pic (once!) to try to get rid of the writing etc to take the shot, it goes back to its original size which often cuts bits off (otherwise O wouldnt be resizing it).	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
The newest update is much better. I can now view notifications without having to arrow back through all the notifications to get to my newsfeed.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This thing crashes every time i ever leave it to check messages or do anything that isnt on facebook. Its slower than the old app by a few minutes. Anyone know if i can downgrade to the previous version? This is actually making it not worth using fb on my mobile.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Nice	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This version crashes quite often , pics take forever to load / upload and why in the hell does my news feed keep showing posts from 6 days ago ( mainly mine) mixed in with current ones ? And app crashes constantly while viewing group pages , freezes on occasion --- has to uninstall and re download it twice when I swapped from 3GS to iPhone 5	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook only works for about a minute and then quits loading anything. Constantly have to exit out of app and shut it down just to get it to load.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Shuts down out of no where sometimes but overall a pretty good app	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Once in a while it freezes and sometimes it crashes. It works but it could be better	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Wish it would stay on most recent status updates and not have to be changed so often!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Good layout for the iPhone iOS but needs to be tested for bugs more thoroughly and updates need to be better tested	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Cool...!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Not sure why it is so poorly rated overall. It's pretty slow sometimes but overall the messaging and posting are all much like using a computer to access Facebook. Status updates are generally not really up to date on the news page, lags eons behind, but notifications while slow to load are fine.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I would like to say a suggest why theres no signature like it used to be (by Facebook for iPhone )	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Having the "feeling" options is nice as well as the picture editing.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app won't remember my update setting so I have to keep switching from the default News Feed to Most Recent every time. Then it doesn't even filter the updates by time, they're all mixed together. Nearby also is useless now. I want to see where friends have checked in, not what restaurants are nearby.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Features slowly being added but still lacks the functionality of the full app. At least it doesn't crash as much on the iOS system anymore.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I dont see how this app even gets a 2.5 rating overall. Freezes constantly while other apps are performing fine, after the update crashes every startup. Wont even open. The creators never fail to let us down.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the most recent update, the app doesn't work anymore. It just hangs on "updating." I had to delete it and reinstall it 3 times, it then worked for all of 5 minutes each time before hanging again. I'm done! Deleting the app and accessing it through the Internet on my phone and iPad! You'd think by now the developers would have had their sh*t together!!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good app. It lets you keep in touch with friends and it didn't crash for me. The new update was amazing and I think this app is great.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

This app works good but my problem is your friend request is faulty I had requested a few friends and family and of course overtime they never responded, but your app suspended me saying I didn't know these people. Well I do know them and your app doesn't give a great option of explanation to the request you need to fix that... Because your questions make a person feel like a stalker.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I used to like this app, then something was updated and I can't be on it for more than 5 minutes without it crashing. It seems to like crashing right before I send a long message that I have to then type again (likely several time).A Facebook app is great to have but this has so many bugs it's almost unbearable. With this new version I can't even scroll through the news feed without it jumping back to the top and creating replica upon replica of every post. I've deleted this app and re-downloaded it over and over and to no avail. So facebook: instead of adding features with every update that create more problems, how about you fix the bugs once in a while.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
They keep changing it, and everyone it gets worst. You can't see all your friends post at once, you have to go to different categories. Facebook had gone down a lot.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Everyone is right. It 's getting better but it still crashes too often!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The interface of this app is wonderful, but it crashes all the time and lags when I want to look at photos/videos/posts. Fix this and you could have a brilliant app, until then I remain totally unsatisfied. Each update is worse than the last, I think it's time I start using Facebook through Safari, at least then I'll be able to perform trivial tasks without the app closing.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
It's very slow. I have to always re open the app just to use it. Then when I can finally use the app it crashes. I think there has been to much stuff added to it and its slowing it down big time.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This latest version of Facebook is the pits.  The timeline will not update, photos do not load, and comments will not load either.  I need to constantly turn my iPad off to reset the program.  The love-hate relationship I already have with Facebook is turning into frustration-why bother mode.  Time to go back to the drawing board.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ever since the update -- in News Feed mode as well as Most Recent -- it will show a few recent stories, and then various stories from earlier in the week (like from 5 days ago). This means I miss out on many friends' posts. Please fix this issue.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I use it because I essentially have to...if I had a laptop ALL the time I would probably go to FB on there more. I even have to use the web to get on FB on my phone to get certain things done. It's not the worst, but it's not always so convenient either.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I have an iPhone and fb loads FASTER using safari vs the app. Also the new update? The app crashes constantly. You'll get two stars back when you fix this. :((.  Annoying!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashing is a normal occurrence, photos aren't an option at all, no privacy controls, boring and stupid "features" that we couldn't really give a care about, slow even with excellent wifi. Sometimes I feel that developers only read reviews that have suggestions that they can do easily so it makes it look like they're actually doing something when they're really not.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Has issues though I use it often. I could take or leave the app. Kinda gets stuck in a loop and refuses to update. Quite a bit of opening and closing the app to get it to operate.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

So tired of this app being slow and crashing!!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Use this app for FB and you will constantly be opening, closing, reopening because of screen freezes.  FB need to add functionality That allows page admins a chance to delete photos.  We are currently a member of a buy, sell, trade page that has over 5000 photos on board so it is impossible to use the app with that much data on the page.  The admins say they are not able to delete the old expired photos.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes WAY too much on my iPhone 4. And when I go to look at pictures, it freezes and then crashes. I get excited every time I see a Facebook update...but nope, never fixes the problems!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
When can we start to reply to comments like we can on the desktop version? Also, I want to be able to zoom into a picture without it snapping back and not removing the text down the bottom.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It's absolutely mind boggling and astounding that an app used by half a billion people daily could be so poorly executed. It does not bode well for the future of the site.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Since the update, in simple cant use it, won't work, updates all the time, can't see new posts, SORT IT OUT!!!!!!!! The fact that u HAVE to rate before submit, not worth the star	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok I just wanted to say that they must have retrained their techs!  This has got to be the best update for Facebook through my iPhone!  I am scrolling with ease	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app has been improved over the years, but there are still some short-comings. You don't have all the capabilities that you have on the full website, and there's no reason for that. If you want to share something (photo, video, etc.) there is no way for you to place a caption on it. It just shares it the way it is.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Your over-40 or visually impaired users would appreciate an adjustable font size on phone app! Or at least the option to go landscape so it's bigger. I prefer just to use the browser because the app slows my phone down and doesn't allow zooming in on photos. Crashes, especially iPad version.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
All these updates and no one can make the recent post option actually show recent posts? If i want to see recent posts, my first post on my feed shouldn't be from 11 hours ago. And the ap has been crashing more than ever. Get it together fb	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
STOP UPDATING the app, it just seems to crash more and more as you release updates.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Does not do Page Feed, still have to use. The web version.  But the web version doesn't do Flash well, so stuck doing both.  Don't Like.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

FB is probably my most used app. I love being able to stay connected with friends. I'm not a huge fan of the way the news feeds breaks down. I'd prefer for an option to review ALL entries chronologically, which doesn't really work with the "most recent" tab	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It won't refresh my news feed or anything Just horrible	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Like this update. Pics and comments much easier to access!! However most recent post should be automatic.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Try to be more sensitive to visual impaired. We want to be involved also!  Still not able to use all your features with voice over technology. Still doesn't work well for speaking soft ware.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Whatever "upgrades" have been done recently have not been helpful lately.   The app just spins and spins instead of refreshing, it won't sort by most recent, and I can't get a photo, or comments to open to save my life...   Also I've noticed that when I 'LIKE' photos/comments via the app, they  don't appear to be LIKED when I view Facebook on my computer.  This app has become so frustrating to try and use, it may have cured my mobile Facebook addiction...   :(	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Doesn't crash like previous versions	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The Facebook application for IPhone is slow and laden with bugs and operational errors.  Try to upload a pic, get kicked out of the app.   Try to "share" a post, get kicked out of the app.  Try to tag someone it tags that person and the next "friend" down in your friends list.  Locations are way off. What a mess.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Decent app but disappointed on the lack of options in the pages side of things and it always says I've got 5 notifications when I really only have 2, other than that keep up the good work	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Overall I like the app... Wish there was a way to love or dislike something! :)	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
I genuinely give this app NO STARS! ... But I am forced to give 1. What's up with crashing EVERY SINGLE SECOND? I try to type a long, important message- NOPE. WE DON'T THINK YOU DESERVE TO TYPE THAT, SO WE ARE JUST GONNA CRASH. This app. Crashes as much as the average person. That's a big number.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's Facebook	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app crashes constantly upon opening it. My feed always seems to be the same with new updates not loading. It takes a long time to load friend's pages and viewing photos is time consuming and a nuisance. They take a long time to load and usually freeze.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Difficult to rate an update as I have no previous knowledge so am learning whilst on holiday, lots of time. There are bits that are very hard like removing an older status but no doubt I will work it all out. Great fun to use though. I do keep having to go to Google to find out how to do something, I have very few teenage friends to help me maybe because I am in my late 60s, but I do have some!	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

This app is very very well set up in terms of potential and you have access to everything you would on the computer. Although, it ALWAYS crashes but that's not the most frustrating part. News feed doesn't load, messages take forever to load, only half of your friends list exists. Very slow. Terrible app but it could be great. Until they actually fix it, don't waste your time.	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I said in the last review that I loved everything but that it crashed too much... The crashing seems to be fixed, but this new feature, every notification gets a black bar over the top blue bar even if it's just because someone liked my comment... What's wrong with the red number that updates in real time and that's on top ALL THE TIME? I can see that I got a notification, I'll check it! That annoying black bar just impedes my navigation through the app 'cause it prevents me from using the navigation while it's there... So basically the app is just slower and THAT's unacceptable for a useless feature you still don't get Better than 3/5	1372057200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada

My only complaint is that I am still not confident on what I can do or not do on Facebook, but I am learning every day. I enjoy the different post and pages of individuals or groups. I don't care for the political connotations or "rants" , as I fire back when I see stupidity !I am experiencing problems logging onto FB and then I will be knocked off it numerous times , mostly early am and early evening !I am very frustrated with FB with every up-date they do. After the last up-date, I keep getting knocked of and have to tap the icon to restart. I then, have to locate my last location, only to get knocked off again.

From worse to worse. As usual. Tired of mobile FB apps that don't work. There was nothing wrong with it initially.  But FB ALWAYS has to 'improve' it with features that don't even matter. Chat bubbles? Seriously?  I hate this app, especially this stupid non-functioning version.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time you "improve" you make it worse for the users.   Why don't you listen to the people who still use FB? People re leaving in droves.It is really no star but the comment ill not post without one.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The new updated version doesn't tell the correct time last active. The old version would say "13m" or "36m" etc. this one says everyone is "1m" then jumps to "1 h". Makes no sense!!! It doesn't account for the time in between that hour now!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

With the last update the app will not update recent feed. I have deleted and reinstalled it several times and still no luck. Just wondering if this is happening to all or just mine? Hope there is a fix soon.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

No complaints. It works for me.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Incredibly easy to post pictures en masse, edit my profile, and keep connected to my family and friends. The app hasn't crashed on me at all!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Not only is slow at loading the wall feed but lately won't even show the new messages even if you close and open it and re open it and re re re open it :@	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook is everything that you need it to be.  From keeping in touch with friends and family all over the world.  Brilliant way to keep updated on what people are doing and sharing pictures of everyday things.  8/10 :D	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

I got this app and like it so far but I make pages and can't seen to be able to Change or add a pic to my page	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I am always on this app keeping in touch with family here and far away. I like the added new features but I would like the Event view ability coz for some reason I still have to go to Facebook online to view events. But other than that, I really do enjoy this app!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashing all the time now! Stop adding crapping gestures that slow down the app!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This crashes all the time. It's the only way I'm communicating with people back in the states, and it crashes at a terrifying rate. Needs to be fixed. Then back to five stars. But crashes wayyyyyy too much.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook crashes all the time. Why is this happening? Even after i updated. I updated thinking this would go away but no. Whenever i type messages or wanting to post something on walls, it crashes. Please fix this. :(	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
Frequent crashes (though with no discernible after-effect but anger). Slow starts on a 4S. Can't copy content out to share as I see fit. Ugh.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I enjoy the added functionality of the new version but it is remarkably slow. I've gone back to using the mobile web-page.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app keeps crashing on me, gets annoying when I'm half way through writing a messages and statuses. Also noticed that it will say that a friend was online 1 min ago when they wasn't.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
You should be able to add whomever you want. Its their choice if they accept you or not. Or else i would give it a5	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This is an absolutely disgraceful application. It doesn't work whatsoever and is extremely tedious to use, as it crashes constantly and has too many animations that slow everything down.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't even comment back to people on a post I made. The city I live on is flooding all over and telling my friends and family is such a chore I'm going to have to turn on my laptop to do it. Epic fail for convenience.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Yep, yet again the app doesn't update. Even after dragging the screen down many times, on wifi, the timeline doesn't update. I compare the app to the web and there is a lot of posts missing from the app. There is no shortage of ads though. Thank you FaceBook å¨ Mobile App for failing yet again. Keep up the great work.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Okay it keeps saying I have 10(!) new notifications so I tap the app then look at the world, the messenger and after the find friends and... Nothing :( I love Facebook yet not this notification mistake. HELP!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Facebook is a huge company that brings in significant amounts of money. Does anyone else find it ironic that it's the worst app on the market???? It never loads things properly, tells me I have notifications when I don't, doesn't show me information the website does, doesn't provide crucial functions such as untagging photos from the cellphone app or changing the profile picture from one in your camera roll, and it asks me to add/"update" information to my profile everyday and I have to skip through multiple steps. All these stupid problems should be fixed and I have no idea why they haven't already.....	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

So much clutter. Bubbles?! Group settings in the newsfeed?! "Your location is being shared" popup?When I'm trying to chat in Facebook messages, only 1/4 of the screen can be used to chat! The rest is UI fluff.Not to mention advertising Facebook Messenger everywhere. SO UGLY.This is a terrible update wish I could revert.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I live it and use it a lot!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I wish that choosing "most recent" for my feed would actually show the most recent posts. I shouldn't have to keep refreshing it with the result of getting different mix of "recent" posts each time. Too bad, FB.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Kicks me out of the app almost 3 or 4 times every time I try to use it, doesn't give me all notifications and very slow!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I tap the Facebook app it sends me to the apps connected with Facebook. Whenever I try to close it, it sends me straight to candy crush.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I'm surprised when the FB app stays open on my first attempt to open it. And if I try to open a link from within the app and don't immediately select "open in Safari", the page I was reading and the app crashes. I thought it was just my iPod, but I'm seeing that this is a basic problem with the app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

EVERY time I open the app for what ever reason, pictures, videos, status updates, chat, messaging, or just looking at my news feed, it crashes. I can't even search a name or page anymore because within seconds of opening the app, it crashes. It's very frustrating because I have to open up my Internet browser and go to Facebook from there. There's no point in me even having this app. I can't use it. All it does is take up space on my phone.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Horrible! Pages won't load and I've had to uninstall reinstall several times because it freezes up.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
You'd think after updating this app about 10 times in the past 2 months all the bugs would be fixed. Nope. It closes down on me all the time. When you click on stuff, sometimes it works & sometimes it doesn't. Photos take forever to load since the update. You cant always delete posts. And I hate that you can't see the hearts anymore.. I'm about to delete it & just use the browser because I never have problems with that. Come on apple/Facebook- get it together! ;)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Early on the app was very slow and limited in functions. With the constant updates, the app is improving and you can so most of the things you can do on your computer. I use it everyday and it gets me through my long commutes in the morning. It's fun reading all the updates ppl post, from family, friends and pages that I 'like'.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Sometimes posts appear duplicated and other times comments appear not to get stored. It has also shut down unexpectedly. Overall not really impressed.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Facebook has improved except that on mobile other people should not access to your friends list unless you permit them to! Also there should be a easier way to suggest friends! There are a few more quirks but Facebook has come along way!!!Also it crashes a lot and I get banned too often trying to make friends even though other people have thousands of friends!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I use this app everyday so I really don't care but I like it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app still shuts down from time to time but for the most part it has been easy to use. Don't really dig the conversation bubbles but it is easy enough to get rid of them, of course they are black the next time you open them up.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I am tired of how FB is trying to control everything. I am sick of you telling me to stop typing so fast and delaying me answering my mail because I type fast. I have thousands of friends and have many chats open too. Grab a clue and fix your security for people like me that are NOT spammers. Figure it out. I tell everyone about this issue and can't wait till there is another site that can be utilized without this issue. I will then get all my 4,500 plus fiends to move there as well.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Photos do not appear correctly (seems like they are zoomed in and cropped; some occasions it freezes completely and becomes clunky). I haven't had much problems previously before update. Now I find myself re-downloading it to fix the problem(s). Please Facebook sort your stuff out, hundreds of millions of people must be using this app; one would think to conduct extensive checks to ensure user experience isn't compromised and not use the masses to check for you.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

Well, i cant view messages, i cant reply to messages, it takes 5 minutes to refresh my news feed, cant view any pictures, cant comment. Using safari for facebook is faster than using the app, come on developers, you can do better	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Their new update didn't work. It just keeps refreshing the page and doesn't let me click on stuff.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My Facebook app on my iPhone 4 stinks. It is VERY SLOW, it hangs and most of the time I have to open it 3 or 4 times before it works. I never had these problems until the last 2 or 3 updates.   I hope Facebook can fix these problems.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Not impressed at all! Never wanted timeline to start with!Don't like private message service is just like chat! Some of us don't use chat for a reason!No impressed and making meUse Facebook much less~actually one of the few positives!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
It lag when I scroll and lags when I open or get off it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sort it out yet AGAIN every time I check status of people it's pot luck what I get "news feed" or "most recent" when I pick which one i want I want it to stay that way until I want to change it. Most frustrating.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

This is by far the worst app on the App Store, laggy, glitches, incomplete you're better of on safari	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I have no problems with the app I am on it constantly and at all hours . I do not use the game functions though	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I think the facebook app for the i phone wants updating so its the same as other phones and the Internet so you can add icons to your statuses without it saying feeling happy watching tv etc.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

I love Facebook. But it's frustrating when it crashes and I keep having to go back into the app and find what I was about to comment on or just look at something. Updates needed....	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
No problems using the iPhone 5 ... With our iPhone 3GS it crashes alot. It needs to be updated to the newest IOS ;)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Constantly crashes, almost unusable. Deleted, reinstalled, still junk. Updated, still junk. I get half way thru a post and it just closes all by itself. Junk	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works good so far. Only complaint is my notifications have no sound on my iPhone 5. All my setting are correct just no sound coming thru... Anyone else having this problem???	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Works just fine for me.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
this app is fabulous! what it should come up with now is a video feature but not one that is similar to vine or instagram, a video feature that is a Facebook original!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

A highlight of my day.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app has crashed idk how many times. It freezes then closes & does it 3 or 4 times before I can open it. I don't get all my notifications, then It tells me I have a notification and I check & I don't & I can't clear it. Facebook app is useless! I use safari more.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
A racist called my boyfriend a typical slang word. I responded to what she said to defend him, repeating the word she said and put it in quotes. They kicked me off Facebook for 12 hours. They didnt kick her off.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It crashes more often now! Seriously, what's wrong with ya'll updating, adding new features yet can't fix the bugs and stuff. Smh! Won't be surprised if there's gonna be a better app than this, soon.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seriously it's hard enough to try and stay in contact with friends and family while traveling but while my city is being evacuated for the worst flooding it has ever seen and trying stay in contact with my loved ones to make sure they are all OK is even harder when ur app crashes every 2 minutes!! I've already had a few friends who were almost killed by the flooding and I would like to know what is going on without having to reopen and re-scroll to the bottom of my newsfeed to confirm people are OKSo please fix the CRASHING!!Also, have u not noticed that with each update u are changing the stars are going down? Please fix it, make it work and don't make it worse because I u put ur mind to it u could make a great app instead of making it worse‰Û_	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I have no prob with the Facebook app, I just have one request for an update.  I create Photo Albums on my iPhone with pictures, and id like the option to upload these albums onto Facebook directly, instead of having to go thru all my photos on my camera roll and re-select them.  It's super annoying to re-select all the photos after I've already chosen them for an album.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It works fine to me. It does pop off sometimes when I try to get on fb but I think that's my phone causing it. But to me I like it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Quite a lot of glitches and it crashes	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
The new updates are great and the app is overall very well made and mug quicker than it used to be.My one complaint would be that when you click to post your status, the keyboard doesn't pop up automatically. It used to. If I want to post a status, I need the keyboard and not photos. Otherwise, I would tap on photo to post a photo. Other than that, the app is good.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
They finally gave the users the ability to share posts, took them long enough. I haven't had any problems with it crashing like other users have mentioned.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes like no other. Have to open, reopen, force closed, open... Til it sticks. If I'm lucky it will stay open eventually. If I was in the middle of posting something when it crashes, I'm SOL. CRASHBOOK	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Never any problems. Newer version is a lot more user friendly. I love keeping in touch with my family out of state. This makes it so easy!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's not just once in a while that these crashes occur. It's every single time you open the app. The next update should really address this issue.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Scrap the new update and make one where you can take a photo from the iPhone and make it your profile pic on the mobile app. I agree with a previous commenter as you have ruined a good app. It also always crashes. C'mon it's still horribly slow so fiiiiix thiiiis!!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Uploading pictures, changing profile and banner pictures need to be easier.  Too complicated.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

When this app isn't constantly crashing, I seem to keep having network errors. The thing I don't understand is I have perfect service and am connected to wifi. Everything else works, so why can't I look at my messages or anything? It seems the "better" you try to make the app, the worse it gets. And to top it off I had to jump through hoops to submit my review that you have so desperately been asking me for.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Excellent app, easy to use and faster to load. Need to improve picture changing and able to save picture like it was before	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

Would be a lot better if it didn't have all these adds!!!! I hate click like if you have blue socks comment if you have red... This is to be able to communicate with people NOT sitting around scrolling for hours because there are stupid adds everywhere!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

When we first bought our ipad, I LOVED how we could toggle between our different accounts (bc more than one of us use the ipad) when we signed off without having to type in login info.

Crashes consistently. Have had to delete and reinstall multiple times. Often triples posts and allows no clicking or searching. Which leads again to deleting and reinstalling. No good on iPhone. Keep hoping the updates will help, but no luck.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I like the chat feature and looking on the news feed is ok too. I don't like the fact that you cannot, or at least I have not found out how to, change the banner picture using the app. It does seems to crash every now and then. I do not like the chat bubbles, they are distracting to me. I would much rather have a chat area that you could click on and enter into a chat room. I also wish they had multiple chat so that three or more people could chat together in one place privately. I like the group features of this app. Overall, It is 50/50 on pros and cons. Thanks!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I love Facebook and I love the new chat bubbleheads! So cute and hilarious. I'm happy for now :)! And I love having a profile pic and cover pic.

Thanks	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Will not load.  Look at all of the negative reviews.  Time to fix the issue.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I have been trying to download photos from facebook to my ipod and everytime I go to my photos on facebook the app closes. This happens frequently at other times too. I have tried 10 times now and have only been able to successfully download one photo before it quit on me. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it and it still isn't working. I am super frusterated. I want to chuck my ipod out a window.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The last update is making the app freeze ALL the time.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Facebook is a social media that has been very helpful. But it has also cause problems. There is a lot of drama. But I guess that's involved with the people I'm friends with no Facebook. It has lost many accounts due to new social medias. And it's just going down hill. I have deleted my account over five times and made a new account. But Facebook also has some bright sides to it. You can share with friends. She what everyone is talking about. Talk to friends. And have fun. I suggest you et it and give it a chance but everyone has their own opinion.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Absolute rubbish!!! Constantly having to delete and reapply it because it crashes all the time. If it happens again I'm just gonna use Facebook through safari. You might not be able to do as much through safari but at least it doesn't implode all the time! Zuckerberg, you're on money for nothing!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Application closes way too much. When it does work, the application either won't allow you to see but the last hour of news thread or it won't update to current threads. Nine times out of ten the application stays on showing threads that are hours old mixing in new threads.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

When i want to look at a picture, it's so slow it takes like 2 minutes to just see the picture. Not the loading ciecle. That doesnt take too long. Please improve.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook's apps are notorious for weird choices, but the new drops own alert thing is ridiculous. It pops into the way and if I am in the middle of writing an update and accidentally tap the stupid pop up, I lose what I'm doing. The text in events in non-selectable. If I want to copy and paste an address from the event into a map application or email to someone else, I can't. It keeps just trying to open crapple maps. I can't select any text from the description either, which is stupid. You all spent so much dev time on the silly bouncing chat heads that you didn't notice the basics. Or was selecting text disabled for some inexplicable reason?	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great graphical user interface and I must say its an excellent app. The chat bubbles were a good addition. The only thing that I find annoying is that you can't change your favorites in the chat bar.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Since last update the Posts are all mixed up when you select most recent. Most recent to me means they are in order from latest post and so on. Pretty crap	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Easy to use. A lot more intuitive.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It works, kind of. If you really want access to everything Facebook has to offer, use a web browser. The app is quite frankly an ugly kludge.You'd figure a company this big could produce something half decent, rather than half baked.The most recent update hasn't addressed the issues with the application. It is still a kludge. Wayne	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

PROS - The share feature is much better now -  I can finally share to my page, as well as timeline and friends.  It is expedient to have the comments open on the same page, rather than have to wait for a whole new page to open.CONS - it freezes and crashes more frequently than before.  Opening new pages still goes slowly.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
When I am on and try to load my newsfeed it can't load new posts.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is a complete waste of time. First of all, loading "most recent" stories takes forever and it still seems to show stories from a week ago. Loading messages takes for ages, and it often crashes. Facebook on a computer is 100 times better. FIX IT.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Pretty good upgrades each time	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love FB, but if u guys could dosomething about the crashing and freezing up almost everytime I click on a picture that would be great. Other than that it's cool.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm sick of this annoying bug where when I check on a notification that takes me away from the news feed, and then I hit the back button to return to the news feed, the app locks up. I can't scroll up or down or hit the black bar on top to zoom back up. I have to close out the app and go back on every time.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
With all the new updates it runs very slow.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Once I'm actually able to open the app and it stops crashing, I'm no longer able to actually view my messages. If i try to scroll to much it will freeze or close the app and its practically impossible to go to someone else's page. I don't see the point of the app if nothing works.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The app has always been decent but please get rid of the chat bubble, unnecessary and annoying. Please, pleasr add an unfollow post button to mobile! I don't need updates every time someone else posts in a friend's update.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Stupid app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My app constantly freezes up, or is extremely slow, and sometimes just automatically closes itself. I'm really not impressed.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Good app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

My Facebook app keeps freezing and closing....Doesn't open some videos.....I don't like the new chat with the bubble things.Other than that, good app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
OMG the facebook app is sooooooo broke, it's always crashing. Pleeeeeeeeas fix the app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Quit changing everything. Yes I agree I don't need your biased top stories.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Face book is great for keeping up with your friends and news. I am having problems of being slow once in awhile opening up on my iPhone. Also there is times where it will not come on at all on my iPhone. Now there is times it completely closes you out, and times you have to reopen more than once.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app is 100% perfect and its only 4 stars but I can't delete the albums because on my blackberry,when I log in on the browser/fb app it shows the albums eg: some are empty and some you want to get rid of and if you can keep everything the same in the app but the only difference is you can delete albums which is a good positive thing then I'll rate your next updated app with  my suggested feature 5 stars and I'm not lying because I really want my my empty albums to be deleted but your current version won't let me.And also it keeps crashing sometimes on the app on my phone when I'm trying to login.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Even with the latest update , this app crashes ALL THE TIME. Get your act together millionaires at Facebook and do some actual work this time and FIX you app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Loving the new updates not having a single problem with it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This new update is even worse than before! Lagging when scrolling through the news feed on my iPhone 4s. Whenever i click "send" button while chatting, it freezes for more than 10 seconds. Also after opening a photo, the app either crash or freeze, i have to re-open the app everytime. This update is weird. Thinking to uninstall it soon.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Dislike the circle pop-up when you get messages. Why not stick to old method of a red 1 when you have a message beside the message envelope?Also annoying that you can't view interest lists in app. AND it sometimes randomly kicks out & goes back to home screen. That's agitating.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Fix the photo, i have a small auto-zoom..	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

So it seems that I'm not the only one experiencing constant crashing with this app. Really, Facebook, really? You can't even stay open for more than 3 seconds. No wonder this app isn't as popular anymore.. It crashes as though its programmed to do so. It's happened so much that I made it a game and timed it to see how long it lasts before it crashes.. In other words, I can't even use it for Facebook anymore!! My advice, just trash the app and use a browser.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Mine doesn't even work! Fuming. Really bad update	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Finally hit the spot on technology, I like everything about it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It constantly freezes up and takes forever to come back. Getting so tired of it. Thinking about just getting rid of it with the so many bugs anymore. Takes to long to load anything. Not happy.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

My most used app! Not perfect yet but get closer	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I love the whole idea of Facebook, and I really enjoy using it. However, I absolutely hate the way Facebook is coming up with repeated changes which risk our online security. Thank goodness we have people like Kim Komando who stay on top of these issues & immediately advise us on these changes & what to do asap to protect ourselves!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Does not show most recent, does not show all posts! A lemon!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
This app is so awesome because you can do everything on it like you do on a computer (: You can upload pictures, videos, talk to friends, anything you want (: I would get this app	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Sometimes it's a decent app. At other times its a shocking annoyance. Takes ages to update,double publishes,still gives ridiculous options. But you know you stick with it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
What a mess, it does not update and shows posts out of order!!!! Like the staff reviews, is it really that bad you have to have staff on saying fantastic when its running like crap.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Improvements on messenger would be nice.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Always changing. Always got to be concern with the security of my info.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Always crashes when I look at my own profile or friends profiles. Can't even change things in my profile because it crashes before I get a chance. Please fix this app so it does not crash when people are using it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Every time I want to share or write a post I have to make sure it's done posting because if I try scrolling through the timelines before it's done, it bumps me up to the very top. I then have to scroll back down to where I was. Not really a big deal, but it can be annoying when I only check my feeds once a day and have to find my place again. It's done this throughout several versions now. iPhone 5, 6.1.2	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm giving it 3 stars because I can get on the app and do some things but every time I want to view a picture it's fuzzy. Aside from posts people write I'm lucky if I can view the picture they tag along with it. Very frustrating! Also there needs to be a DISLIKE button. I'm sure many have said so but there are so many posts that I'm sure people would love to hit dislike instead of like on. And if I am the first to say this I should be paid for thinking of it. Just an idea. Keeps crashing on me!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Terrible app, too many problems to list individually. Ignore this app and access FB via your browser	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
App runs slower than ever. I can't even load the app past the initial news feed page. Good luck if you want to see anything other than the last 10 minutes of news feeds.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The FB app has been kicking me off for weeks. It's now even worse after this update!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I dislike this system I don't not want people know that!!!!! Others have really good improvement tho	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Latest versions have made it grind iPhone 4 to a halt and drain battery. Deleted app and reverted to mobile site and battery problem has vanished. Oh and as for the unbelievable amount of ads... Absolutely dire.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It ok	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

LANDSCAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Morons who program this app. Why are you so stupid!?!? LANDSCAPE ORIENTATION IS BASIC FUNCTIONALITY IN IOS. It was there initially! Why would you take it away????	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Butts.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Does most of the things you want.Please bring back the ability to set your news feed to display most recent posts. It gets annoying having to set it to that each time I use the app. Apart from that it's a good app. Could do with quicker loading times.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Why can't we just have most recent actually. All the stories since my last visit chronologically. Pre set as a rule. I am so sick of missing what people post because this app chooses what the "top stories" are. I'LL DECIDE WHAT ARE THE TOP POSTS FROM MY FRIENDS ARE NOT YOU!!! Please.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Decent update but still Would be nice to "share" photos and post them on an individual friends wall. but No problems at all,  does what the update says for me!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I don't like it one bit!!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Can't open my messages :(	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
My Facebook is crashing and it crashes at least 4 times before I can use it as well as the Facebook messenger. Could you please fix it for IPhone and iPods. Thanks!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Ok? Y'all still didn't fix the problem where I can't change my custom audience from my status update!!! It used to be there and now it's not! What the hell man? What's the point of the update? I don't want just anyone looking at every last thing I have to say! Now I still have to open safari if I want to censor my posts! FIX PLEASE	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I can't see the Recent Posts by Others and albums on fan pages with the mobile version for iPhone. Please fix it and put the icon.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Every time I look at pictures this app always closes on me! Why!?!? Please fix this bug because I'm getting really frustrated with opening and closing the app all the time.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
C'est tout.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It keep going well since the last updated. But I want the app to supports background image in chat as well as many other social apps that allow user to put their own background.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Since the iPhone 5 got the new updates , it seems Facebook has too, however I'm not sure if there is a problem with iOS 6.1.3 as it often suffers from crashes and freezes. Prior to the last couple of updates it worked fine. I assume Im not the only one having this problem	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
With each update this app goes backwards. Useless.Still no recent post by other.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Sim, semi-funcional! Pois dÌÁ muitos erros, e chega a dar respring quando eu tento apagar! Reiniciar o aparelho sÌ_ por causa do facebook nÌ£o Ì© uma boa alternativa, pois nem sempre resolve	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook was ok sometimes it would randomly just go of an back onto your ahomescreen of your divice and it would freeze a lot.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's a great app but I would like to be able to turn my screen sideways and/or upside down. I can't use it properly now because of a dodgy screen.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
This app is becoming, the most efficient one of all versions released.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Will not update! Had to delete app and try again... Still nothing!!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Bring hashtag support	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Liking this update seems to be very smooth	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Every update makes the app slower. It is so slow now that I stopped using Facebook on my phone completely! They really need to re-write the whole app and make it faster instead of just dumping features on it.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slow! Can't see my updates! It's just awful!!!!! Keeps shutting down! Can you please put in a custom option in the privacy settings? And post editing without having to delete the whole post.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I don't know when I leave Facebook chat it still shows active which is very stupid. My friends tells me ignoring them.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Works fairly well on the iPhone, but when trying to reply on the iPad, I can't see the text I am typing. As I have 2 Facebook accounts, one for work and one for pleasure, I would like to be able to access both accounts easily from this one app.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Me encanta estar en contacto con Mi Familia. Y fb me ayuda en eso :-)	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	New Zealand
They have a share button but every-time one uses it, the app flings them back to the top of the newsfeed.  Stupid.It still does this and it's still stupidAnd it keeps changing the newsfeed sort.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I can't download. This isn't working. And i can't get into my Facebook page. Please fix this now please!!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app has a lot of good qualities but its constantly freezing and crashing and it takes forever to load. This is the main reason I'm never on fb and it needs to be fixed	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app now lacks all common sense elements of good design and flies in the face of what a GUI should be like.  Problems too numerous to describe here.  I'm left thinking that the software design team is a bunch of morons at Facebook.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pathetic. I can't even get the app to open at all and I've deleted and re-installed it many times and still nothing.! Optimise the app for iPhone 4S and other devices, not just iPhone 5!!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Plz bring bak the old layout-much cleaner and easier to navigate. Wanna downgrade version....	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Update: 6/18/2013 - Version 6.2Nice improvements!  LONG overdue on being able to change the privacy settings on posts via the app.  Still wish there was a way to edit posts after the fact for spelling and typos.---------------------------------------Update: 4/17/2013Oh Facebook - you release yet another app update and fail to communicate to your customers what you've fixed.  When will you ever learn?I guess someone figured out you left that part out because I see a new sentence has been inserted to the release notes & version history. Sheesh.-------------------------Update: 4/16/2013New version seems decent.Regarding news feeds:  I like that we now have an All Friends view.  That view was removed from the web version quite a long time ago and I think it's led to a decrease in friend to friend interaction.  I've heard it's back in the updated news feed for web, but I wouldn't know since I haven't been upgraded yet despite signing up on the waiting list the day it was released.  Also regarding news feeds:  I have at least 30 interest lists and now they are all mixed up in the list.  Shouldn't I be able to rearrange those lists or at the very least, they should be displayed in alphabetical order??I agree the "new stories" popup is a bit intrusive.  Messages: pretty cool version of multi-tasking since you can have a message open and scroll through your news feed without losing your place in the message, or the ability to have more than one message open at a time.I would still like to see a landscape viewing to have a larger keyboard for typing comments and messages.---------------Update: 11/6/12Still no landscape view, can't edit my own comments, newsfeed isn't show the most recents posts in chronological order, even though that's what I have selected.  And worst of all, the app constantly loads.  Scroll down the page a little - app loads, scroll more, app loads some more.  I really haven't noticed any of the upgrades in this new app although I'm told there are some.--------------------------------------This new version is great!  Haven't had any crashes, it's fast, but I'm disappointed they've taken away the ability to use landscape view.  Also, I've hidden almost every game and app posting on my regular Facebook newsfeed and yet the FB app is still showing them.  The app should honor all the display & privacy settings that are programmed onto the main site.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This new app is great! At 70 years young, I am suddenly able to be shown once and can remember how to do something on my IPad2.Good Work Guys! There's hope for me yet.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

So let me get this right, you've just updated the app. And Im expecting no more crashing, but no, it's still crashing. I'm typing long paragraphs to my friends, and suddenly the app crashes, do you know how frustrating that is? And it happens like 50 times a day, and I have to type these long things over and over again. Please just fix the app..!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

You should make it so that people can watch videos on the iPhone. You can't watch videos unless you scroll on their timeline. There should be an album that others can go to.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

App takes forever to load a d freezes at least 3 times a day, forcing me to restart. This started after the last update, I thought updates were supposed to make the app better, not worse!	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Just downloaded the update released 18june'13 and now FB KEEPS CRASHING. way to go.	1371538800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Thank u	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Is more problematic now. Real issues with posted pics. Usually start off blank and load really slowly or force closes the app when clicking on them.  Also clicking on comments takes forever to load. Seriously not as quick as it used to be. Needs some adjustments badly. Sometimes doesn't update. Frustrating app now.  Crashes frequently. :-(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great update I really enjoy it xD .. Keep up the GREAT work!! And the bugs were fixed.. Awesome	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love FB app. New and improved	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good app, good layout and all, but you need to fix the crashing. Every time I open the app and stay on it for about 2 minutes, it crashes and closes down. There had been an update but it still crashes. FIX IT	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I am about to uninstall and reinstall it again, the 3rd time in 2 days. It stays stuck on "updating".	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
With each new update the app just gets slower and slower and more unresponsive. I dread updates. Gotta live with it though.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

It could be better. Seriously	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Slow. Slow. Slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app has gone down the drain...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like it, it works well. It's easy to use and I haven't had any problems yet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
There have been some bad updates to this app but this one takes the cake ... Constant crashing ... Comments disappearing ... Takes forever to load a message ... Make the bubble thing optional ... Please just fix the constant crashing and poor loading urgently	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
A few glitches like any app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Great Social App To Keep In Contact With Others Around The World! :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Buena aplicaciÌ_n, buenos grÌÁficos	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still crashes and hangs. Daily.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I use this ish everyday, and every feature never always works, but the new features being added offset the hooplah. Unfortunately, irreplaceable.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Sure it was awesome last month, but now it's just horrible, it crashes 20-30 times daily, it lags at recieving messages and sending pictures takes multiple tries (around 10) sometimes. Pictures that you post sometimes don't even show up on your timeline, photos, and activity log.It's a good app but it crashes too much, lags, and has too many bugs	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Awesome App works flawlessly on my iPhone 4.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like the new changes but its a little slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Realmente muy acostumbrado a esta aplicaciÌ_n. Lo mejor, estar en contacto con muchos amigos y familiares.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love using Facebook and everything, but they way they have updated the app makes it to where it crashes.All. The. Time.I would be nice if it wouldn't, you know, crash when I'm in the middle of sending a really long message.And another thing is, when ever I try to post a comment from time to time it hardly goes through! Then I get paranoid that it will post the comment 600 times a few minutes later.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Excellent	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I love Facebook it's amazing<3	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The Facebook app is atrocious. Freezes up, crashes, takes forever to load, becomes frequently unresponsive. Great job making a terrible app. You'd think with the billions of dollars Facebook is worth they'd be able to make a simple, functional app that doesn't take forever to load.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Awesome	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's just ok.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Does what I want it to while on the go.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app except that it crashes, daily. Also not overly thrilled with the latest update but that is minor. I find it crashes multiple times, daily. Very frustrating as I then need to scroll all the way through to get back to where I was. Please fix this and I will gladly rate you a 5 star app (:.Okay folks, the app has crashed for the fourth time today, right after I hit on a link to go to an article. I hate having to now go back, five hours, to find the page I was on. Something is very wrong with the app. It is happening so frequently, daily, that I am about to give up on using this app for good. Please fix this issue. I can not be the only one experiencing this!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It would be nice to copy and paste things. Also it does crash quite a bit.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I would love the beta version back, the one with the low menu bar.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I love this app, it works easy everytime	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Too much bad language  & too much skin showing. Adults are not the only ones that have FB .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app. Can't wait to see the next round of new features. Sometimes bubbles are annoying and also the app crashed when i scroll through posts that are on pages but its whatever	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Great app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I wish they would make it automatically load the most recent.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Me encanta	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Amazing!!!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Its alright like	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
The app doesn't stay up. It crashes several times. I'm not able to find friends from other states. It would be great if you could put in more information than just a name to search somebody(eg. Birthday, job...).	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
App was working fine then boom update messes it up ugh	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app opens & closes numerous times before being able to use. Can't unfollow conversations, just not as many options as accessing it through safari	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
I am a Facebook addict, basically. I love the app, it's easy& simple to use.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
If you can live with an ever growing intrusion into your personal life & affairs, it's an okay app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
There are a few new features which are nice to have, but this version also became unstable. There were several occasions where I was in the middle of the surfing, and the app crashed on its own. The worst problem is that sometimes the comments posted will "disappear". This is frustrating after typing all those words. This needs to be fixed!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Very good	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
This app is fast not slow like the other app and all my friends used it just needs some work a lil bit	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook has had it's moments, but oh boy it has reached rock bottom with directed adverts and outrageous promotions of date sites and even promoting apps to locate and meet woman for god knows what! And it it won't be tennis.. It's cluttered and far to commercial... If like me you just want to catch up and keep in touch with people then it works.. Watch your privacy settings though.. It's open till you close it...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I can't upload videos anymore, it just blacks out and goes back to the home screen! And when I'm trying to add photos to my albums well, it does the same thing!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Keeps crashing lately.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app worked fine until the last update and since then it will not load anything. iPhone 5.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It's a great app. Love it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Apps pretty good, now if only we could get u to delete stuff off the Facebook servers, ie personal info, msgs, pictures and other data collected and stored over time even when deleted from Facebook by the host of the profile. Save stuff that matters, there's no need to save a picture or message / convo that was deleted by both sides. Archiving is stupid too.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
The app seems to work decently enough, as of late... The site is often the broken link in the chain; but then, that's Facebook. :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
FB does not update. No notifications until after I log in.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good so far. Does occasionally crash but not to bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Not impressed at all:(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My fb app crashes all the time and I hate not being able to copy satuses	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
How come I can't change my cover in this app that's a fail if u can do it on a iPhone or iPod what's up with that u should make one	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am extremely disappointed that this site has so many girls and guys that advertise porn pictures and other things related. My husband and I both stopped using MySpace due to this problem and now it's moved to here. I see so much more of it now than I did four years ago when I originally signed up. I read all the time that this site won't put up with it, but yet it is on here a lot. I don't want to delete my page because this is the only way I can see how some family and friends are doing due to this is the only place we talk and they live too far to visit. Well thank you for listening and I hope things will be done about it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Thanks for opening a whole new world for me!  I didn't even know what I was missing!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
crashes constantly.. and starting today, when trying to view a full post to comment, nothing happens. the news feeds doubles/triples the same post instead. using the mobile version until this is fixed.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
CANT OPEN IT PLEASE FIX IT	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Work just as well as the full site but is missing note drafts. Also missing search bar in page mode.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
My only concer in sharing stuff, get it fixedAnd some more improvements such as messages, photo albums and maybe deleting and editing comments.Overall its GooooooD!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Neither here nor there on it, though it doesn't allow videos to be uploaded.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
The upload function for photos on IPAD is horrible! Why on earth are we still having to upload one at a time and why oh why do the groups keep kicking me out right in the middle of me putting one photo up at a time when someone else posts on the group??!?!?!?!?!?!!!! So f ing frustrating! This app for IPAD doesn't show current updates. Doesn't matter if I click on Top Stories or Most Resent. It won't refresh. IT'S SUPER SLLLLLLLOOOOOOOWWWW!!!!!!!!!! Twitchy. CRASHES!!! The last version functioned better on IPAD.Fu Facebook, fu	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Much better	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Won't let me see recently posted even if I keep refreshing. Zooms in on pictures an then when I try to unzoom, the caption is in the way. Slow. New 'chat bubbles' are always in the way.Always crashes, especially when I try to look at a picture.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Needs to show most recent posts first. I can go scroll back and find the old ones on my own. It seems to get worse with each in updates	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
How can one rate something which has changed the social fabric of modern society? Rate Facebook? This is far too complex. Even Margaret & David would struggle.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Why won't you fix this?  Haven't been able to access FB on the iPad for 2 months.  Are you just incompetent or just don't give a rip that your customers can't use the app?  Just wondering.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works but wish it was like the desktop. Hard to delete posts and posting is private not public.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
If something works, don't fix it. By doing this you have rendered the app useless	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Used to be such a good app. Now it crashes all the time, loads items from days ago before recent stories, and the recently added chat popup is super annoying. Would be nice to have the version from a year or so ago... Not nearly as buggy.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very bad version it crashes every two minutes!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I find that it is quite slow loading pages and messages . But all in all s good application	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
It's good but SLOW a lot of times and shuts down all the time	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Very disappointed it won't let me upload my videos. Rubbish. Needs sorting. Don't like this latest update at all	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Love staying connected with everyone....could we have a dislike button!  : ).   Have a problem with sharing and app taking me back to top and some off my feeds are like they are attached to each other.  Finally used to the messages and like it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good stuff	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

To be honest the Facebook app is pretty good, two thumbs up!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
After selling our personal information for a large amount of money Facebook is now littered with ads.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app has stopped working properly. It does not update and stalls when opening.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am not expecting home computer stuff	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Recent update won't let me share/upload photos onto my FB.Fix it please!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It crashes all the time I have to open it re open it then open it again,it crashes ever time you open a photo it's slow an updates make it worse.PLEASE FIX THIS	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So I was casually scrolling when it just suddenly locked up. The scrolling screen locked up on me. Other than that every thing works. Just the news feed wont let me scroll.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new added features are ok but the fact I can no longer view albums from pages I like is a huge problem	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
When I first got this app it was horrible! But, since the last update, it has (finally) quit crashing! I was having to delete and reload on a daily basis! Now, it works great! No more crashes! Thanks FB!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Why should I review fb? Everybody luvs  fb ~ rite? Wrong! I hate the new format ~ a lot! I luved it b4 but now, not so much! They even took my profile pics off! Why, fb? I've asked u like a zillion times 2 put them back, but noooo! No answer n no pic!!! That's part of my review ~ the rest wouldn't b printed!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I use Facebook often, but what I don't like is the fact it crashes and I have to log back in. Luckily my username and password are stored. Otherwise I'd stop using the app all together and just go on Facebook through my computer.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Last couple of updates have definately added some cool features but my phone is bogged down now. app constantly crashes and I'm just not happy with it anymore, so I've been using twitter a lot more than usual.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Wonderfull	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I don't know if its the new version causing it to turn off all the time but the timing is suspicious!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's ok could be better	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Acceptable to keep up with FB. Don't like the fact I can't delete messages from FB message options. Some pages I follow have trouble loading pictures & seem to freeze.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
If I could give this zero stars I would! It crashes all the time, it hardly lets me see pictures, and just as fb on your computer, it's ALWAYS changing making things more difficult and stupid.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Wish that this app would stop freezing! I've had to uninstall and reinstall several times on my iPad And my iphone. This is very frustrating !	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Bafore the page was more flexible like widescreen mode. It's difficult to type.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's vaginal	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
There needs to be a capability to edit your status post ... spell check is not always user friendly. Also, why no emoticons within fb 6.2 version for iPads ?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Instead of adding a message bubble that is annoying and unnecessary, how about you fix the crashing and stupid slow load times.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Just like any app and social network it has it's ups and downs. I like it, yes I have issues with it on some occasion. But honestly 8x10 it's working perfectly fine. Nothing is perfect so everything is going to have its issues. It's weather you can get over them to see the bigger picture. All n all I love FB.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Meh it's okay it's getting better. This app seriously used to be the biggest piece of garbage out there. But with the continuous and sometimes (however rarely) useful updates this app has a scrap of hope.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Works really well most of the time. Glad they finally added the ability to share. AA+	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's an okay app, I guess.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook has got better updates faster apps cud do better with pictures	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Brings you close to family	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The only way to get it to update is to delete the app and re-install. Worthless on the iPad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love Facebook for keeping in touch with family members across the miles. :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This new app never works. I can't login and when I do, it works for about 5 minutes, then it's right back to not working. It takes forever to load the feed. All around a poor app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Incessant ads in the newsfeed, lack of control over what I see. I only like the part where I am connected to friends & family.And now repeated requests for ratings. I will take this opportunity to gripe about the weird algorithms that dictate which updates I see on a particular device. How about as they are posted, not as different feeds.

The new update layout is awesome, I'm loving it so much more then the old one. A bit buggy though, not sure of its the app, phone or cellular connection but gone up no Internet service a lot.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

After people like or comment on a picture / status. Facebook decides to hide it from me. And show no likes and no comments.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it. A few glitches, like disappearing comments, but says that comments are suppose to be there... And they are there when I go online but not on the app. :/ but hell, I love Facebook!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Don't like that ur pictures open up first when posting on iPhone.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's really irritating that my application tells me I have way more notifications then I really do. Doesn't happen to any of my other apps and my iPhone 5 is in pristine condition and I've NEVER had an issue w it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am not a true media person but I can say this app is much better than the blackberry app! I'm pleased!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The layout needs to go back to the way it was. The new one with the buttons at the bottom is somewhat aggravating.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Good program	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Ever since your last update I've had trouble with getting bumped off and my key board gets stuck on screen and has to be manually dropped done.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Some times I can't post pic:-(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The updates were very much needed. Could still use some improving but heading in the right direction. Can finally do the feeling updates too!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
This app is so slow and it constantly crashes. Please fix... Also the bubble chat icons are so annoying too in my opinion. :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Just pathetic. Very very slow app, crash problems and full of bugs. -5 stars :@	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It is a living magazine & you are the editor, controlling its content, viewers.  I get to learn, laugh & see what my friends & family are up to.  It has also helped me plan a trip to Baja Sur, figure out side dishes to a party and give me gift ideas.  I am a fan.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Why does this friggen app keep crashing when i open albums and photos. I just happened 3 times in a row. Peice of s***! Fix whats broken before 'updating' with new c***	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Ahh yes. Another disappointing update full of nothing accomplished. Hands down the worst app I have on my phone. Constantly crashes, photos don't load, and for the love of God please fix the orientation so we can type properly!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Personal I don't like this update. I'm tired of too stories, because they're so irrelevant and please get rid of the spam posts asking for likes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Awesome app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Except for the nagging do you want to rate this app.. I've given my review already, now just stop nagging me.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It sometimes has my post show up twice on my wall. The news feed takes to long to update :(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Thank you for feeding into my Internet addiction	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm sure there are a lot of people out there like me.  I have an iPhone 4S running IOS 5.1.1 and when the App Store told me there was an update available I said, "Hey!  Cool!  Maybe they added some new features..."After I updated the Facebook app, four days or so ago, it crashes EVERY TIME three to four seconds after launching it.I have tried uninstalling then reinstalling [Seven times now] and am having the same problem.  Facebook is one of the largest social networking websites out there and they put up a update that just destroyed the purpose of having the app in the first place.Get your s*** together Facebook and give the people who supported you through all these years and helped you become what you have and give us a working app for our phones!I digress.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still crashes the odd time but overall I really like it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
As I said it crashes sometime and get really slow even on LTE speed.  Needs a lot of improvement even after that many years. Still disappointed.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Yep. Can't post statuses or anything after the last app update on my iPhone 5 Facebook app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a great app if you like ads for products and companies you have no interest in, if you like cats, and of you like apps that constantly pester you to rate them and bug you 5 times a day to turn push notifications on.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It needs to remove the contacts on the message board when you remove them as a friend	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love the FB app! Does what it needs to do!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Since the most recent update, the App no longer works on my iPad3.....it just spins its wheels saying its "updating" but never does.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the app because it gives me access to FB as you would in a regular PC and it works fine but it sometimes crashes and will not show some updates. Other than that it works ok but it is limited by the iphones functionality.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love it but WHEN will I be able to view my uploaded videos album?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I've really never had any huge problems with FB (apart from another shite update a while back), but since the last update the statuses don't update when opening the app.Sort it out developers! It seems a lot if people have had problems with this latest update.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Would be wonderful! Minus the fact that it crashes constantly..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Im giving it one star because everytime it krep on logging out of the app everytime its annoying!!!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It some times froze when i see the new feeds stories try to fix that other then that its nice :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
I love me some Facebook!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app crashes multiple times DAILY! No landscape view, which can be annoying, and it freezes constantly. Not happy!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The only problem I have with Facebook is that I can't become a friend now with someone I reported and blocked several years ago, other than that its great to catchup with family, church and friends both near and far!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This Facebook app is much better than the web site on an iPhone.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app keeps freezing on the news feed part	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Still, crash all the time!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I used it on my iPad as long as I could.Crashes often and repeatedly, even after closing all apps and re-booting.Many many bugs make it very frustrating to use.What is up with it always opening in portrait mode?  It used to open in whatever orientation I last used, which was always landscape mode on my iPad.  It won't rotate easily to a desired mode either.  It hangs onto portrait even with numerous twists and turns.  Very aggravating!Now it comes back to the News Feed after reading a story and says there is no stories to open.  This is ridiculous.I gave up, it never stays up long enough to do anything.  Went back to the browser version on my PC.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It crashes every time I open the app, but just like everyone else I keep trying until I get in.... Would be nice to get in the first time.... Also would like for my pictures to load faster... Thanks for giving me access to my friends an family.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still has a few kinks to be ironed out but other than that it's all good, finally being able to use feelings in the statuses is awesome as well!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Don't know if each version is getting better or getting worse?You'd think it would be better with all the money they make from data mining.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
This app was great at the start of the year but every upgrade it gets worse and now it keeps mucking up I have now just re loaded it for the 7 time this is so annoying I just want it fixed it just keeps freezing 1/2 through writing post fix it please	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
It's Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
ok you guys fixed my last problem and thank you but I have a question now or a statement actually. I think we should be able to unsubscribe from people's status's on the app rather than having to go all the way to the web fb and do it their. thank you =)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook gon be hear 4 a while	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
My Facebook messages will not load from on my phone. When I click on the message icon it shows the message that I have and I can read a little bit of it but when I click on it, it shows nothing. But other gets my messages. It shows I have no connection when I have perfect connection and it even works from my lap top.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is the worst app update ever. I had to delete it since it is so useless.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the update... Everything I do takes forever on this app! Then it crashes! Pls fix! It's my most used app!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

wanting a way to hide all photos from those who are not friends.. like your profile pics and coverphoto..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Before the most recent update, the list of people who liked your post would be in chronological order of when they liked it, with the first liker at the bottom of the list and the most recent liker at the top of the list. Now everyone is in a random order every time the list is opened. I like to open it to see who has liked my status since the last time I was on, and this makes it impossible to sort it out. Please go back to the old way of listing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's extremely convenient, I absolutely  love, never even use my comp anymore, I like this WAY MORE! So get it!! Still feel the same!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Hey for some reason the comments aren't showing up on my Facebook! Fix it please! Other than that's its alright	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
When are they gonna get this app right? Unreal, app is very slow to open after selecting icon. Once open app is not responsive for a long time. Finally, it  allows you to navigate around. Select status, nothing happens for a long time, once the window to put your text in comes up your ready to just close the app and move on. Come on Facebook, get it right. This is getting embarrassing for you all! I am embarrassed for you. Either get it right or pull the app until you do get it right.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

What is wrong with the Newsfeed? It's not consistent. Sometimes it shows the most recent posts. Most of the time it shows whatever it wants. Also, the photo tagging doesn't work. Fix those and I'll give you more stars.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It takes forever and a day for this app to update my news feed, even when I have plenty of service. I also don't like that even when I tap "Most Recent," it doesn't display the most recent activity.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes all the time, really slow, and since that last update my "recent" newsfeed is sooo not recent. Idc what was posted 16 hrs ago! I want NEW news!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Problems1. Very slow to load timeline.2. I usually opens FB app when a "new message" or "new whatever" badge appears on its icon. I think others would have similar tendency. Then the red "new" counter on either "messages" or "globe" icon should be displayed as such first. I think it should get users' attention. Then it should load the new "whatever" first. However, right after opening it, the red badge is not drawn there, and even though i click one of those buttons, it doesn't list any new. ( if it already put the badge on its home "icon", i guess the program should maintain the data for the new messages already. or it should at least have some info on them.3. Pinned Posts   On Web, pinned posts is not visually apparent. But anyway, it's expanded by default like other posts on a group page, for example.    Then, on this mobile app, it should be the same. However, a user need to click "pinned posts" button to reveal it.  Because it's not so apparent if there was a pinned posts or not, users can think "where is that message I just saw on my PC?"4. Why there is "scroll to more info.." thing on the setting's page? there is no more lines to scroll up! It just waste time!5.  Duplicated posts somehow.    Sometimes, it displays same posts twice.6. many other things..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Exelente aplicacion para interactuar con amigos y conocer mas personas	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's crashing way too much! Even when not multitasking!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update to the Facebook app is great! My only issues are that it sometimes freezes and closes itself for no apparent reason, especially when going through other people's photo albums. Also, sometimes my notification thing (when the app is not open) won't clear itself after I've went through them (ex: It says I have 12 notifications, so I go thru them and they are cleared in the app but once I close the app (sometimes) it says I still have 12 notifications). If these two issues were to be fixed I would rate this 5 stars.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Frequent crashes, pictures taking ages to load, News Feed in complete illogical order - typical Facebook update! Idiots	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The app opens normally, but when I select most recent it shows me stuff from two days ago that I already saw instead of new stuff. Stop screwing around and fix it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's okay- could be better... Like the new layout but crashes way too often.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I gave this app a 4 because the only real problem I have with it is most of the time when I want to see new status' it takes like a min and a half for it to load but that's about it on my end.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

What's going? The app is crashing today	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This stupid app is so slow it's practically unusable. It crashes constantly; doesn't go into landscape mode; makes many of my posts disappear into thin air when I touch "post", after painstakingly typing a long post...I hate this app. I now view FB with Google Chrome for iPhone, which is fast and isn't bogged down with useless features and DOES go into landscape. Don't waste your time with this app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love to use Facebook. But sometime even when we are still using, Facebook is close by himself, pls better fix this problem for us..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I'm not sure what anyone else is having problems with but I am still amazed and thrilled to be able to see friends and family that are far away and get to share drops in the buckets of their lives.  This is an app, a tool, and is not a trade for a real life.  In the iPad version, this update I cannot change my background photo but I can on my pc and phone so I'll live.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I cannot edit photo caption or customize privacy settings of particular stuff, like photo albums. I hope it's gonna be possible in the future.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Yeah I'm addicted to Facebook and it craved every 10 seconds its almost not worth having.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
FB doesn't fuss with the app as much as they do the website. I only use the app now and if it weren't for the app I'd still have my account deactivated. FB, don't fuss with this too much or I'll leave again. Keep it simple please.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I like everything about Facebook, except the Timeline feature. With the Timeline, I can never find any of my past statuses or notes. Everything gets lost with Timeline ... Or maybe it's because I don't know how to use it effectively.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

I use this app alot as i have no desktop, i agree with alot of the previous reviews about "posts from others" and other things like that, what i would most like to see is improvements such as tagging possibly photos and maybe even feelings on the status bar for IOS in the Notification slider	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Not user friendly...crashes and hard to search for friends....post appear then disappear...then appear. However it'sy only communication to family from all over the place!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I, admittedly, spend a ton of time in Facebook! Not only does it allow me to share my family's life with friends and family, especially those far away, but it also allows me the opportunity to look back and remember...remember all the great times I've spend with my husband, children, family, and friends. It allows me to relive memories and really capture them in true time as well as pin point specific dates, times, and events. Having the app mobile means I'll never miss an accomplishment of my children, a memory with my husband, a night out with a friend, or a family BBQ...I'll always be able to look back; years from now (as long as FB stays alive, which better be a long time) and almost be able to relive my life (at least from the time I joined FB), almost day by day, year by year, and post by post. Most of all it will allow my children to timeline their life, it will allow my children, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, and so on to relive our family's life. Memories won't fade, pictures won't be lost, and our history will be documents and easily accessed. Thanks FB!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Every time I click on a friends page or picture it crashes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's wonderful!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Way too many changes.  Makes the mobile system very glitchy and slow.  Always moving or deleting things that I use regularly.  Seems to ask too many questions of a personal nature that I do not want on the web.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Needs a few more features the desktop site offers though, but getting very close.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Wish you would fix the app it's force closing on my iPhone 5, 4s and iPad. The app force closes since the last update please fix asap	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Worst mobile app I've used.  15-30 second pauses for no reason.  Crashes a lot.  FB should be ashamed of itself for writing the lowest quality mobile app in existence.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Most recent doesn't work and has posts from 3 hours ago in between posts from 20 mins ago	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Nice app. No problems. Yet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook iOS devs can't seem to get it together. Can't pan and zoom images properly. Crashes constantly.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I mainly use this app to coordinate events for a wide range of reasons. Unfortunately the app won't let me do anything of the sort! What is the point d the app integrating with my phone and calendar if they won't let you update or change event details??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Constantly crashes. Extremely slow. Messages will not load. Worthless app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps crashing!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
this app is so, so, so frustrating! its gotten worse and worse with every update! stop focusing on adding stickers and stupid things like that and start focusing on actually making it open and stop crashing. terrible. just simply terrible.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
The features are getting better but it'd b better if you could see friends birthdays easier!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It's pretty sad that with this most recent "update" (if you can call it that), is still 'littered' with bugs- if you will. You're gonna have to step it up, dudes, if you want happier customers. It's gotten to the point, that I'm tempted to remove the app, and just access FB with the Internet app, instead. Step. It. Up.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The facebook app works really good, i love it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can not believe that Facebook people are not able to make a decent App for iPhone. This App is not reliable. It takes ages to load so you loose interest. It is challenging me to stop using it. Please fix it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Great!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Worse app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My app keeps quitting on me. It's annoying. Also, when im messaging people, when it says they saw it the thing says "Seen Sunday at 8:32AM" and it won't change.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Love it. Works great.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The only reason I use this piece of Crap is I haven't found something better.  I can't give it zero stars	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
When i start to scroll down it will take me to the top or it will open up some stupid page. It shows an add every 2nd to 3rd post, i try to open up a post and it opens an add, wont let me send messages to group pages (i.e. radio stations) even though they promote sending messages to them. Regular crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

So far, I haven't had many issues. The older version blacked out a lot, but the update is much better!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The fact that I can't access my others folder from my mobile is so frustrating! Oh and also that I can't delete my wall posts from mobile	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I'm not loving FB or its lousy interface. With all the money this place makes you'd think they could do better.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
All this app does is crash. I try and view a page, CRASH. I go and hit the "see more" button, CRASH. I want to view a picture, CRASH. I'm getting really tired of this app right now and all it's crashing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app on my 4s deserved 4 stars before the last update. Afterwards? Not so much. It's takes forever to load, and if by some miracle it does load, then I can't view pictures. I've been using the mobile site instead of the app. Sorry to say this, but this Facebook app is really not worth my time because it's such a pain in my rear.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Don't always like the changes but it's a great way to stay in touch with old friends and kin.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
No problems.... So far anyway	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It crashes every minute. The worst app i have ever seen. I don't know what was wrong with older version. This one is a real headache !	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good app just wish you could unfollow a post on the app and not just the desktop site...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I see all the bad reviews, but I don't have any of those problems! I really enjoy this program.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes after the new update even tho it says its gonna fix the bug when your about to update and you check for details,I would like to have that fix ASAP for all user and so on..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I want to be able to view my newsfeed how i want!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Glitches constantly. But it's better than no facebook. After the new update it constantly crashes. Fix it for the iPhone 5.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
People can complain about this app all they want, but I dare them to switch to just about any other kind of phone's version of the app for about a month or so and see how they feel then. Yes, it has glitches occasionally. Yes, it drives me crazy sometimes. No, it isn't perfect. ...welcome to technology.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Lags a bit but in general great app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
There is something going on with putting pics from my iPhone storage onto FB.  It's stretching them on the normal computer and making them tiny when looking at them on my phone.  I end up having to delete then because they look awful.  Please please fix this!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So ever since the update you guys took out the index alphabets on the right side of the friends list. Now you have a big search bar on the top. Not cool or user friendly. I have many friends that I can't remember everyone's name. Please put that index on the right where I can just tap on the alphabet to see all my friends with their first alphabet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great app. No problems at all.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Freezes & Shuts down. It shuts down every time I try to get into my Photo Album. Very Annoying. FIX ASAP.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I agree with person who says "crashbook" I'm never in this app more than 5 mins at a time if I'm that lucky and sure cant message anyone because messages won't show up in bubble chat but shows there is new messages	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My only complaint is, I would like to be able to turn my IPhone sideways again to use FB.... Bring Landscape mode back for the entire FB not just photos!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I had just finished updating my app when all of a sudden, poof! It disappeared. Now normally I would just re-install it, however it won't let me, it only says [open]. Looks like I'm stuck with no app...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This app may not be THE reason for living ;-) but it sure makes living so much more fun when you can share it with those you care about. This app makes sharing a breeze and it just keeps getting better and better.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love this app 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I wish it wouldn't crash so much! It's gotten better with the updates. But I hope they fix it better	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I was surprised when it let me upload my profile pic !! Good job facebook :))	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Crashes everyday, throughout the day.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook used to work fine, now it takes like 3 times of trying to open it before it will actually stay opened, once it's open it works fairly decent though. It just gets annoying at times!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The facebook app is buggy. Cannot comment and have to keep logging into facebook using safari. Come on fix it and stop making stupid changes. RESPECT OUR PRIVACY! RESPECT MY AUTHORITY!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

With each update / upgrade the mobile apps (iPhone and iPad) there are more & more crashes and a few glitches. NOW the current date & time on my iPad no longer appear at top of screen.

App is choppy when scrolling and notifications don't show till you manually refresh them. Update seems to have caused this	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Rubbish new update now won't load just keep seeing timer !! Sort this out this is a major app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

It slow and I want the old version back.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's a really nice app but I dislike the new bubble chat style where the person you're IMing is like a little bubble floating around on your screen and it doesn't seem to refresh very well.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Please fix this app.. I can barely look at a picture without it freezing or having to reopen it! It crashes way too often	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Before the update it ran really smooth but after every time I slide the update bar on my home feed it freezes and I can't do anything while it tries to figure whatever out and I'm not one to write reviews but its was getting unbearable plz fix	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Can we please get functionality to copy text from posts within the app. Also, it would be great to be able to edit previous posts.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Another update and still no sound notifications.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
When I upload a picture and have all of my tags and captions (+ how I'm feeling) it never shows up after its uploaded. Just the picture, no captions, tags, or feelings. Please fix this. It gets really annoying when you have to go back and edit the caption on the safari version.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Much better!!!!! But really STOP deleting pages!!! This is America everyone has a right to express them selves!!! Delete pages for animal cruelty or child porn, NOT BDSM or the military, the very people who make it possible for you to have a job Facebook!!!! Just stop being an up tight church lady who thinks they know what's best for the world!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Add this feature on the facebook iphone app pleaseeeee( Comment with Photo )	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Seriously if there were something else where my connections were, I'd be there instead. The platform for iPhones crashes multiple times a day. There is no way that I can find on the mobile or full version to block spammers in my messages. Not to mention FB now spams your news feed with stuff you have to hide, but if its liked by some one you know you can't hide it or report it as spam. So it's a sacrifice between crashing and privacy issues and access to where all my pertinent social contacts are. And by the time the fixes for the multiple daily crashes occur, the app is updated and brings more bugs that crash the app...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Lets me stay in contact with my family. Love it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Keeps shutting down have uninstalled and reinstalled that many times now, it works fine for a week then every time u read a message or comment on a statuses it goes back to the home screen on my phone and iPad, I'd give it no stars but wouldn't let me only been happening since last 3 updates	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

It is a black hole devouring moments of my day that I will never get back.  As the years go by the time wasted accumulates, life wasted, not lived in real time, but sadly experienced vicariously.  It's a tragedy our society endures.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I like it FB	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I don't like this version. Don't like all the adds and the constant repeat of older posts from weeks ago.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Pros-Being able to share posts to your page rather than just your timeline.-Like the feeling setting in post a status.Cons-Keeps reverting back to top stories when you refresh news feed rather than most recent stories.-Don't like the fact that when you send someone a message their photo stays up on the side of the screen. I know you can just drag and remove it but it's just annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
-Unable to view comments in "photos of you" -Great that you made it easier to delete comments by holding down the comment you want to delete. -Easier to change audience of posts after posting. -Landscape option would be great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is really good to use but it crahes everytme I open it!!!Pls fix it!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I always have to open & reopen this app cause it keeps getting out. It's SUPER annoying . Fix this.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I love the app but the constant changes kind of get old and some changes are difficult or not explained well enough or/if not at all or make things harder...just depends and once you get used to one way, you have to start all over again and start a diff way....but other then that ramble I'm  pleased so far!! :))	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
it gets me mad how I have to open it twice to actually use it, & when I actually do use it, it only lasts 30 seconds until it crashes & I have to repeat the whole process.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I use it often and find it easy to use; to catch-up with my friends etc. However, this Apps' only 'downside' is that you can't get a larger keyboard, you know like on iPhones on just simple messages, you turn the device Landscape, and it turns with you, therefore a larger and easier-to-use keyboard. But not on this. Please improve this in the next update; I think a lot more people would like that too...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Also, there are a lot of functions that can't be done from this app. Please improve the app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

You can add all the bells and whistles you want but I still think its stupid that this app won't rotate to landscape for optimal texting. Plus, the additional crashes and pic freezing ain't helpin either.*update* Still adding features that make the app crash. Still doesn't support landscape unless it a pic/video.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Freezes once in a while but it's ok I guess	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

best page ever	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It is getting crappier!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Its all good, just get annoyed that when i post something, sometimes it does it two or three times in a row!??! Good app though.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Horrible.!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Most used app on my phone	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Creo que este "update" es de los mÌÁs significativos, de hecho borrÌ© el "facebook messege" ya no es necesario. Muy bueno y estable, se pueden tener 4 conversaciones simultanias al mismo tiempo. PERO HACE POCO SE "crashes" CRACHEA TODO EL TIEMPO.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Y'all have really outdone yourselves I have not 1 complaint about this app! Please keep wowing us with the updates.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love Facebook on iPhone. Helps you keep in contact with friends you would otherwise never hear from again.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Loving the updates	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Not working at all now. Useless.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Worst Social Media ever made! The fact that things my friends like shows up on my wall and gives me videos that they like on my feed that are either disgusting or very inappropriate, gives out to much information for people to find you off of other peoples accounts just because you liked a post it shows to everyone and TOO MANY ADDS!!! on the mobile version	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is fine but the only problem is that sometimes it doesn't upload pictures for you.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Just wish we had all the desktop options on this app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Hey! Jew scum! How about fixing disappearing status updates that don't post! Hitler was right for thinning you out. Shame he got interrupted before he finished wiping you of the planet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Brilliant!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Fab in most counts my only gripe is that I can't tag my business page in comments or statuses and I hate that I have to change it to most recent on the newsfeed it doesn't stay in it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
The feelings thing is a cool novelty, but I'd much rather my "most recent" news feed have the most recent posts... Not bits and pieces from the last 48 hours... Fb had the news feed right in the early days-as my fave song goes "don't break what don't need fixing"!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Can't believe it keeps getting worse with each update...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Often freezes.App at times unusable, due to refreshing so slowly. Even though connected to a high speed wifi network.Infuriating at times!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Keeps crashing now and then for some unknown reason  please sort it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Just love using it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Best app ever just wish it had faster speeds and less congestion!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Theres nothing to put your news feed into time order. They are all mixed up. Its annoying	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I love Facebook :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I love facebook. It helps me a lot. Idk why i needed it but i love it anyway :3	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I never use FB on my computer so it's good to know most features are now on the mobile version. Keep updating and improving!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Its ok, nowhere near the same as the full facebook but not bad,could do without the constant game adds though	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It's a great app just you can't copy a link or paste but its great really	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
A great way to socialize and non-stop laughs...I really enjoy my time on here with YOU :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's like twitter but no celebs	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Updated the app and it has been crashing all the time. Now all of a sudden it does not let me log in. Dissatisfied	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I think the update made it slow needs faster loading and more things to do	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Why add things if you have problems preventing to use them? App crashes every time to where you have to close the app and restart it only for it to do it again minutes after.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love Facebook but how the pictures show now is pretty crap! Cut the sides of and zoomed in if the pictures where as the where put on then it would be the best!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Slow! Keeps shutting down! Awful app!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This app is so frustrating, most recent status is not most recent it's a mix up of times and dates. You cannot look and search new pages to like.Crashes and you can't tag people in pictures. Terrible.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Its amazing nothing wrong with it :D	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
No bad few problems get fixed quite quick with updates quick and easy you use am	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Hoping the suit it to iOS 7! I'm getting sick of the design. It needs to be easier to use. And really don't see the point in having messenger? All it does is gives me 2 notifications. Silly	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Still crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app needs modernising and making more user friendly! X	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Except for the ads and not really having relevant friends in the newsfeed and while liking being able to post photos on s comment- wwweeeeellll how about no ads, friend newsfeed selection tool, and being able to enlarge and save the photo. Oh and I'd like to be able to see where and who the photo came from in the first place. I find it annoying that the author often gets lost	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love this app it's simple and easy to use.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I wouldn't bother with Facebook unless you want to know what your friends had for breakfast or the progress of their in growing toe nails.If you 'like' pictures  of a children with Down Syndrome, this is the perfect APP for you. You need not do anything more than tap a button then relax knowing you have shown your acceptance.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The app is okay but i only want 'most recent' stories in my newsfeed and when i select that option , it never seems to work.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
App continually crashes, can't even get it to open.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very good for keeping in touch with family	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Gooooooodddd	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashing again....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
No complaints. Keep it up!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Good!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love that I can be connected to Family and Friends even when away from the computer!  The ads leave something to be desired, if I want to look at other things I can search all by myself	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can I go back to previous version? Since updating I am unable to access my Facebook on my phone at all! Extremely frustrating, if it ain't broke don't try to fix it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Does what it needs to do, maybe could be a bit quicker but either than that its fantastic.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Like i said it does wot it says in the name  !!!! But it asks to many questions. Thanks to FB I find my brother after 10yrs.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It's slow to load at times but works fairly well.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This app likes to crash a lot. Especially when I'm in the middle of writing a long message. And the little bubble icons are annoying..	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Essential !. It's mint	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I have tried to be patient but frankly nothing has changed! You would think a multi BILLION dollar company would try harder. Shame on you Facebook. Shame.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
FB is the most annoying app on my iphone. FB team has really screwed up...The FB bubble chat is the worst design and is very slow while sending chat messages..... FB iOS team are you really testing the app performance before releasing to AppStore ??Apple should also create a category called Hall of Shame for these kind of apps.Please get me the old facebook app...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great to be in contact with people far away and close by so easily.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Love it. Makes staying in touch with family easy. Other than the drama that comes with it it's a good thing	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Regular pointless updates and changes to layout and functions!Regularly freezes, crashes and kicks you out of the app!Doesn't show all status updates of friends and groups!!When are you going to get it sorted??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Always shows updates from days ago, should be 'most recent' by default... Always cuts the edges off pictures... Can't see 'others' inbox so have to use a pc to see them.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Facebook is awsome and I love it 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
I like	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
or, the option to do so. only google maps shows me bus routes connected to train routes, and times. i don't want to use apple maps. it is near impossible to get the address after it is auto-sent to maps. i have no idea how.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Keeps on freezing. Annoying	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
Can u put the cover photo feature in the new update please	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	New Zealand
This is stupid! I'm giving this app a rating because it won't stop asking! It's Facebook anyone who hasn't heard of it in this modern age obviously lives under a rock! The app is what it is, there's no alternative so even if it sucked you still have to use it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Still the best for me, the only reason I give it 3 stars is because if someone dislikes you and has a grudge against you it's easy for them to get you banned for 12 hrs without Facebook getting your side of the story... Sometimes the text getting typed, doesn't keep up with the speed you're typing at. Overall tho, still the best social networking app! Really like the messenger floating bubble! Big success!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
When you try to view a picture or get a better view at it by zooming in or clicking it, it FREEZES and I have to exit and close the app so fix it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have restarted and logged in and out, and nothing has worked!! I cannot get my news feed to load since downloading the update! I finally had to start using the web version. Completely frustrated!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok I don't understand this app...I've never had any problems with it at all but I always check to see what is updating....and I always see big fixes....and I'm like "ok I never get those but it should help If I do" well I have to literally reinstall the app at least 15 times a week so that it'll work and I hope this next update fixes it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Really good app, fast moving and easy to use :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Can't take anymore of the constant crashes, finally i deleted it.  No pleasure at all in using this app, just frustration and annoyance. I am on an ipad 1 which tends to crash some apps anyway, but this app is the absolute worst. Every single time i use it it will crash at least once just on start.. Then when it works for abit and crashes again (which it does relentlessly without fail when i am trying to read anything) then when i reopen it it never remembers where i was. Also it never ever remembers i use my ipad in landscape mode. Why??? But whatever, i don't care anymore, its gone.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Totally confusing the share feature is never the same I can't figure out how to use it one time it shares with the person I want and another time it wants to send message or some other post   Don't like it at all. I sometimes just want to share something special with one person.  I was able to do that at one time now who knows what you will get.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why is there no landscape mode?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's getting better with all these different gadgets we can use, but at the same time out of no where sometimes ill be on my page scrolling and it exits! Also sometimes when I click on photos on others people pages its freezes and they don't even have alot of pics to view. Other than that ill give Facebook a 4* since there is more to do on here.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Essential app to have for chatting and sharing random ****.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
just keeps gettin better and better!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I am hoping that if I review this app, Facebook will stop asking. Yes, it works big whoop!June...Yes, once again Facebook is asking me to review this app....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Just found why my iPhone battery goes flat so quick - this app NEVER SLEEPS!!! WHY would I want to repeatedly read yesterday's news, while the new news gets buried down the list?  Most Recent needs to be default.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Horrible in about everything I keep uninstall and reinstall it pfff	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
‰_‰_super fun	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
But oftenly crashes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Great app easy to use, reduce ads and it will be fine!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Some things are difficult or impossible to do from the app; that needs worked on.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
When am I going to b able to use the fb app and have the screen rotate when I turn the phone sideways??!! This is my only complaint, other than that the app is awesome!! 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Please add the ability to customize who can see your posts.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
At times it takes to long to load something's and it crashes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Good but I prefer the old Facebook	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It's ok because there really isn't anything else......Wish I could disable chat on the iPad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
They keep removing options! Why?!?First they removed Landscape mode and now you can no longer view "RECENT POSTS BY OTHERS" on group pages!! Again, WHY???!Terrible experience for iPod Touch owners. This was so much better about 5 versions ago!! 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ìä babado!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have downloaded this app once again and it is rubbish it frequently won't load my messages then when it does it only shows me half a message, it's not even worth downloading	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I am having so many problem with face book most of the time my statement get double and I have to reboot my fone and then log out of Facebook then log back in again to clear it what a pain	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Really enjoy FB on iPhone. Only wish I could open in Most Recent view as default view...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have taken a cue from a friend and transformed my use of the mobile version to photo blog and networking with other artists.  Brilliant.  Works beautifully on my iPhone 5.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
U can't click on other on this app if so how ?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Loved my fb app untill this update everything is so different!! Change it back!!!!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I'm getting so tired of Facebook crashing and throwing me out of the app. I swear it always happens when I'm trying to type in a message to someone - sometimes long, important messages - or trying to read something. Completely inconvenient because I'll have to start all over. Facebook used to be amazing but now (so it feels) you developers are just having fun adding complete useless crap and watching us complain without even bothering to answer our opinions or complaints. I greatly assume you are under a mountainous pile of stress but please, dear goodness, the app RELIES on your customers, listen for just a moment!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app worked wonders, and now it seems to have gone under. Crashes constantly, along with the Facebook messenger app. Can't I use Facebook in peace without it crashing constantly?? I hate to resort to using my web browser. Must fix this issue	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
It's all good to me hahaha this app I use it all the time . :)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Gr8 for keepin in touch with friends :))	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I used to like using this Facebook app, but as of recent updates/versions, all it does it keep crashing time and time again, even after updates that apparently fixed bugs/crashing... hmm I don't think you did a very good job of 'fixing' anything really!!This app crashes for me more and more frequently, even if I'm just on the messages talking to my girlfriend, where if I lock the screen between getting messages from her and replying back, there's a good chance that upon unlocking my device (iPod Touch 4th Gen), then the Facebook app will crash and I'll be back on the main home screens with all the apps! Even when I'm replying the app will crash for no reason frequently and sometimes results in not only having to re-type my reply, but also for some reason the text typing area/box would have a previous reply in it instead of just being blank, even though that message reply of mine was from hours ago, and it keeps coming back when (not if) the app crashes again!I've just removed the app from my iPod and I'm away to install it back in to see if that helps with the problem at all, which I doubt it will, but I thought I would leave an app review first, to let you guys know how annoyed I am with what this Facebook 'app' has become!It's about as bad as the Twitter app changing its layout and adding useless new features, of which I decided to stick with an older version of the app where it works fine and everything was much better too! I wish I had done this with Facebook as well, and kept a version of the app where crashes weren't as frequent as getting messages on Facebook itself!I hope you, the app developers or bug/crash fixing team, have taken the time to read not only my review, but also the reviews left by others who are disappointed and annoyed by this app!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Runs sooo freakin slow & crashes while I'm trying to use it smh this should've been fixed with all these updates y'all have been doing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a fine app but it crashes all the time when at alot of photos and when u try to delete and edit your own. The need to put landscape back on so I can turn and leave comments easier.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
La app antes funcionaba mejor, al enviar imagenes o publicar imagenes se cierra, todo esto desde un iphone 4, espero que lo arreglen pronto.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I jus hate how now every time I wanna share a post that after it loads it takes me waaaaaay back to the beginning of either my recent activity feed or news feed. That's annoying especially when I've been scrolling through for a while. Other than that, great.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I would give the Facebook app a 5-star rating , except it constantly crashes , sometimes takes a while to update my feed , posts a status twice , and it freezes . Please fix these bugs ??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Cannot load updates, I have to reboot phone to get updates. Frustrated!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After a week of dealing with all the crashes and restarting the app for it to just go crash again, I was hoping for an update to fix it! But noooo! Here I am having to seek other means to get on Facebook. Whoever is behind this is showing a great talent at being INCOMPETENT! Get someone to do the job right!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Shuts down on me so often. Doesn't always let me refresh. Gets annoying	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
On the iPhone- and sometimes the iPad- this app just routinely crashes.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good application , it does have a habit  of crashing every so often which can be annoying ...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I hate the new update. Its always crashing. Its becoming more slower. How many bad reviews do you need to realize you should fix these problems?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This works perfectly with my iPhone 5. Better than any other app I've tried for a smart phone. No probs what so ever. Recommended download	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Great app! Constant upgrades! Love the new on screen chat without leaving your page! A++++++ in my book! But what do I know I'm just a user lol good job FB	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's gotten a lot better. Keep up the good work 	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The app is worse than going to fb.com in safari. You cannot delete a post just made from the app or hide the post from your timeline, but safari lets you do it. Way to make a mobile web page better than the actual app...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very entertaining social network.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Every time I open this app is shows loading and nothing ever loads. I have to turn my phone completely off to get it to stop sitting there stuck and running. Very frustrating!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Kind of slow and super glitchy. I get thrown out every day that I'm in it. Videos and photos hang. At times I've been frozen out (crashes upon entry repeatedly or never opens up) and had to go through mobile sign-on which works better than the app!! Also had to delete and reload the app to get around the crash issue. This app is a waste of time and memory space!!! The stickers are fun though for chats.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app crashes and freezes constantly. It gets worse with every update. It changed my choice from 'newest' to their desired highlighted 'newsfeed' no matter how many times I pick the way I want MY newsfeed to be.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every update makes the app that much better!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Like the new update	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I constantly have to delete and reinstall the app each and every time I want to use it! It's always "thinking" and never updates. I also hate that every single time I log in I have to change my preference to most recent. If i set it to most recent it should stay that way until I change it. Very frustrating!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love Facebook, but I can't STAND Facebook mobile.  I have an iPhone, and I use the Facebook mobile app constantly throughout every day.  My biggest complaint is that it takes what seems like FOREVER for the app to refresh the data (update Notifications, show pictures in my NewsFeed, etc.).  I do realize that "things" are technically MUCH faster now than what they were just a few short years ago.  However, we as a society have become so used to those technological advances that we now come to expect it...and we notice right away when something (such as this app) falls short.  Sorry, but we want our data...and we want it now. Perhaps we're spoiled, but that is the reality, and I think that the people who are responsible for the maintenance and updates to this app should make this a top priority.  It doesn't matter how many cool gizmos and gadgets you add to the app if the app, generally speaking, is kind of a pain to use.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Crashes a lot and slow to load.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Yes, once every few days it may crash  but for the amount of  ‰ã_spend on this app, it is definitely notch! It only takes the  blink of an eye to reopen. To the whiners, if you don't like it don't use it!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love the update, great design, great look, but... It tends to crash a lot more for some reason... Please fix. Thanks:))	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Constant crashing, organising the news feed doesn't work, it's a generally average app, quite unimpressed. Not able to edit your posts either	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Suchsssss	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Dope!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Not sure what happened to this app but  it is slow, unresponsive and viewing posted pics is an absolute chore. The freezes every time you attempt to view comments on a pic to the point you need to shut the app down.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Newest iPad, iPhone 4 crashes are beyond irritating. Up to date on software. Have to open it a couple times. Please fix the bugs. I will say better than the update 3-4 updates ago when I couldn't open or load Facebook at all. Getting better, but not there yet.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app, or more actually the whole entire Facebook website is failing me. I'm disappointed. I need Facebook to connect with my far away family but I might need a new way instead. My wall is posting spam posts, without my permission! And when I tried to log out after I reset my password to try and fix the problem and it crashes! I'm very disappointed and hope you can fix the problem or ill be forced to deactivate my account.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The wee chatheads are cool but the app keeps crashing and is really slow	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Much better now. Has almost everything the desktop version has, but still crashes somewhat often.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
IM SERIOUSLY TIRED OF THIS' EVERY TIME I GET ON FB IT CRASHES EVERY TWO SECONDS! IT WONT LET ME UPLOAD PICTURES !!! AND ITS SLOW!!! YOU BETTER FIX THIS NOW!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App crashes all the time. Often wont open at all. Clicking on things takes forever to open, if ever. I used to like this app!  Get rid of the stupid floating faces and fix this app!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good apps works fine on my iphone	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Every update makes the app worse and harder to live with Firstly flicking through pictures is a pain because the slightest movement up it down. Sends you back to your news Feed.     And the app crashes every     5minutes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I don't see why it's that bad. You people are impatient and need to wait and it'll work better?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Ever since I applied the most recent update a few days ago, FB is barely usable!!!I cannot load any photos, create albums, or even sometimes view friend's albums, not to mention the very frequent crashes - MAJOR FIX NEEDED PLEASE!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This app crashes every time I open it. When I can get it to stay open it is slow, but I love the interface. Please fix this.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Don't update to the new version! It doesn't load or update, and if you want to read posts in newsfeed, all it keeps doing is scrolling back to the top post?...Very poor!Updates=trouble!If I could give it no stars I would!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Just uploaded 50 pics into my mobile uploads, but now none of them are showing!! Only 5 are showing on my wall, but people are liking them so they are obviously there somewhere!! I try to tag myself in the ones people are liking but they aren't coming up on my 'pics of me' pleaseeee help!!! Driving me mental.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
I could write what everyone else is writing about: crashes, landscape mode, slower-than-slow, etc. but they're all saying it. Fix those things. Quit coming up with stupid things, like the huge smiley heads in chat. What are we? Nine years old?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great changes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Depends on the version you have as it alternately is good or terrible. Meh.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Wonderful	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I wish they would update this app for iPhone because I have certain friends that don't even show as friends on my friend list nor can I tag them anything because it makes you think you're not friends. Also, they need to update to make changing profile pics etc easier. This app needs a lot of changes!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not updating. Just little spinney thing and nothing happens. What a disappointment.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The only complaint that I have is that the Facebook icon on my phone always shows double the notifications that I actually have. So, for example, over the Facebook icon, there would be a red 4 over it, I'd get excited and open the app to find that I have only 1 or 2 notifications. Forever alone. Other than that, it's Facebook; It's a decent app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I enjoy Facebooking on my phone. I do it often. Lately it has been freezing and taking long periods of time to load photos or open pages. I close the app and turn off my phone restart everything and it still will take forever to load pictures. Even when I have Wifi.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Fix the bugs! App crashes a lot. I gave two stars because I like the design and chat features. Add the chance to send video messages! If you fix it I will rate 5 stars	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great social networking website. The app is great and does everything you want or need to enjoy the site.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Awful app for what you'd expect from the most popular social media outlet in the world. Just bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I love Facebook but I'd love to be able to put multiple accounts on the app. I have two due to my business as well as my personal. So I have to put one in safari and it's just frustrating.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love Mark Zuckerburg but I have a problem with censorship!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
It is what it is.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I try to post something and it tells me it's been flagged as inappropriate or spammy. I can't post anything I stay at one star til it's fixed. This is ridiculous.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why did Facebook do that  ???Previous app worked so fine, done the update, can't load newsfeed properly.Please sort that out or allow me to download old version. !!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It's good! It's great! Now stop asking me to rate!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Stability seems to have vanished, crashing and freezing more in the past week than it has ever done before. 3 times just in the past 2 hours.Also not sure why there isn't the same share functionality on the app as a desktop to share to specific groups or individual timelines...Despite two more updates since writing the above, stability is still questionable, still cannot specify timelines to share posts or photos to, so much missing compared to the desktop version, including copying links etc so I can share them.....still needs a lot of work.I keep having to resort to Safari to get the functionality I expect..surely with all the billions of å£/$ generated, FB could actually get some talent to make an app that's actually works properly!?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Constantly crashes . I end up going on Facebook on Safari or my computer .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I'm sure you know this app has had problems for years with crashing, loading slow, freezing, and not running like it should.  Maybe Facebook should look into getting professional app developers and dump the ones they currently have?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works good, havent had it crash on me, of course I dont spend 6 hours a day on fb talking to friends i never met.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Use this app more than anything...but will crash over and over; usually when initially opening the app and when looking through pictures. Definitely needs to be fixed...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The only problem I have with it is that sometimes it freezes for like 5 seconds when pulling up a picture but it gets faster with every update. It's easy to use and convenient.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Slow. Slow. Slow. Hate it, really. I usually won't update anything but thought, why not? BAD IDEA! I will never get use to this version. Actually deleted it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Get rid of suggested apps in my newsfeed. Advertisements on sidebar are enough. Too slow loading and updating. Too slow uploading notifications.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Overall, not a bad little program, but it can be glitchy sometimes, closing suddenly, and needs to have improved controls for managing friends, blocking people and apps, etc. My single biggest grievance is that I can't edit status updates, comments, etc. I have to go in on my computer to do that, which isn't always an option right after I make a mistake, such as when my phone's autocorrect changes my words on me.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love it	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Facebook is messed up won't load !!!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Not to bad... Kinda clunky and weird at times... They make some stupid decisions regarding security and the pop-ups for the stupid games and other add-ons are annoying!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Some of my comments don't show up on statuses or photos. Plz fix.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app keeps updating but STILL the main prob I have is when I go to launch the app I have to try 2-3 times to open it. Way to go in offering a quality product!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Personally I think Facebook is great. Although about a week ago it wouldn't log me in and it does this to many other people! Bit of a pain really!'	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It's ok for the most part I give it a 5...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Slow. Lacks the full functionality of the website. Crashes. 1 star.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Installing app - it wants access to calendar and contacts - should be an option to add, not one that is difficult to remove!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I like the app, but when ever you release a new feature you remove others...why? Case and point, I can longer manage Group Admins or create Events in a group from the app. Worked before... why remove it?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I have logged out and back in hopes of resetting my Facebook connection. The little circular spinner just keeps spinning. It's the app that has issue because I can login without issue through a regular browser.  It is getting to the point I'm using it less and less. That might be a good thing. This is through iPhone but my iPad had similar issues.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's extremely helpful to communicate with family and friends.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I enjoy using FB and keeping in touch with people I know.  Please keep our info private.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Cons:1) Can't edit a post or reply!2) Can't edit who can see your posts on your page!3) Tagging people is hit or miss. 4) Can't add a photo to a message. 5) Can only share another post to all friends on your own page and not share it to a group. 6) Can't type in landscape mode. 7) Crashes frequently!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After the latest update, the app takes FOREVER to update.  What happened? Please put it back to the way it was before when updates came thru properly and on time. Why fix something if it ain't broke??!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I like FB because it keeps me in touch with family and friends not possible without it.  Having said that, something needs to be done to correct the "flaws".It freezes up all the time, crashes in the middle of typing a comment or even during viewing posts.It is crazy making!  Please fix!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I just upgraded my phone to the iPhone 5, and I love the Facebook app on here! The features are amazing and I have had no problems with it! Easy and fast to upload pictures, notifications come in fine, I love how I can save pictures off of here without having to screenshot! Love it!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Incredibly slow.  Can take 30 minutes sometimes for the message you just received a notification for to actually open up!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

What a crock of poo!With every update this ap just gets worse. Slow is an understatement and as for the new newsfeed view, don't even get me started.I'm only giving 1 star as I like the new chat. Please sort it out	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Best version yet, love it! Clean look, functional and useful and never crashes now.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Updates are quick, on it all the time, never any crashes! If you love FB then this app is for you.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
As far as interactive social media goes you don't get to be top dog on the food chain by disappointing people that being said I've read a ton of negative reviews I don't agree with.  It crashes once and awhile so does everything on the internet most folks complaining probably just need better hand sets.  There's always piggy back apps using Facebook as a means to connect to so it's constantly evolving.  As an artist on numerous projects it makes it easier to have a central go to for pages and groups.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
this app is good for so many things. communication, and meeting new friends, sharing funny things or posting pictures about memories! :) its just amazing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

Over all is a good app. For iPhone ,and I like using Facebook from my phone ,it keeps me from having to use my computer so much .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's ok	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Its all works pretty swell, every update is more and more helpful,.. Although i would like an "Unfollow" button on the posts im tagged in much like on the official website, i keep getting bugged by comments non-related to me through my phone	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The new update has made my app so slow to load, I get irritated and just give up. Why bother opening the app if my news feed and notifications won't load. It tells me I have notifications but then refuses to tell me what they are. Jerk.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Only doing this cause the app won't stop reminding me to update.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Not a bad app. Just wish they would quit changing it all the time	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
As always -- there has never been a version of this app that worked well -- it takes (comparatively) a while to load/update, whether via wifi or 4G.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I hate the stupid new Sent and Read things on the messages. I know what time it was sent, it tells me when I click on the message. Now I keep getting sent and read mixed up, it's so annoying.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Well it hasn't given me in trouble so far so good	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I wish they would leave Facebook alone. I also wish you could invert a smartphone to have a landscape keyboard instead of a vertical one. We don't need all of these changes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It never works. I shut it down and restart daily and it never works. It the worst app on my phone. Facebook is a billion dolor industry. Why can't they make an app that works??	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I have an iPod 5th generation.

What happened?	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This latest FB update has caused my app to stop giving me Notification updates ...it's really annoying because I have to go a browser to actually see the notifications ...kinda defeats the purpose of having an app!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I have never written a review but I have to with this app. It is awful. It hasn't worked in a long time. You would think that with all the money Facebook makes they wouldn't buy their software from the dollar store. Please fix the stupid app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Tryin too look at a picture, get the load bar an it's loading...loading...loading... Crash! No more Facebook. Reopen app. Try process again and bam another crash! Want to look through the news feed?

How frustrating! Tried to update and the app/icon has been stuck on "waiting" for over 24 hrs, can't delete it, can't restart it. Sort it out developers! Why release an update before it's been tested?!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

- still a lot of kinks in IPAD/mobile app - the one thing I'd like to do is edit comments...news feed lists /notifications aren't up to date. If disliked a page, updates continue to appear on newsfeed...	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Useful but slow and glitchy. If you just go to your web browser in your phone and search for Facebook you get a much better mobile version with more actual FB features and less limitations. I prefer that version over this app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
If there was a way to give this no stars, I would. There is NO REASON for a social media app to be THIS resource intensive. I have basically stopped using the app altogether as it crashes 2 out of three times, and freezes my system the ONE time that it does launch successfully. I'm sure you guys are having a high-falutin' time developing for the iPhone 5, but you need to consider that a considerable part of your market still used the 4 and 4S. You have a LOT of one-star ratings right now COME ON GUYS this isn't a fluke.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's legit	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I prefer this app to the web Facebook.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
It's terrible! My app keeps on crashing! None of the updates fixed the crashing :/ Everytime I try toMessage my friends the app constantly crashes. I can't even send a simple sentence because it crashes! Also, when I view a photo it either freezes or crashes again! PLEASE FIX THIS!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate Facebook mobile newsfeed. There are so many options like most recent, following, all friends! I hate these options! I don't want to be seeing posts from two days ago that I've already seen! I want it to be in order. Please solve this problem. It's easier on the iPad mobile version.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Update crashes and is slow. Have to open the same thing twice for the alert to get off your phone. Could fix the bubble chat. Also could use more smileys with the feeling section - you have to create your own and the face does not match the feeling.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app is great for what it does and allows you to do.  The only drawbacks for me are the constant policy and privacy changes you have to keep up with.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Tend to find time line very out of date and times. What I see on my iPad will not match time line on laptop ..far to much advertising on it as well. I use FB a lot so will still use it but its not as good on the iPad etc....	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
It crashes	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I resisted FB but this last Christmas one if my sons set it up and announced to me "you are on FB!"  I am so happy he did that!  I love it and catching up with people I haven't heard from in a long time. I also learn so much!  My husband is always saying "where did you hear that" and I say FB!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Why in the world doesn't FB for the iPhone work in landscape? It's crazy having to type like this. I was able to use Landscape on FB on my old Droid fine although it did crash all the time.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app ebbs and flows, but it is back to a terrible mess again. Can't upload a simple picture. One of the biggest things people do on this app and it doesn't work!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great for keepin in touch with friends and family who are spread far& wide	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Every time I click on a link, the app crashes.  I see that almost every review addresses this issue, so why haven't you guys fixed this yet?  You're seriously slipping on this, guys.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app constantly crashes. On my iPhone, posts are very limited and sometimes don't appear. All that aside; If people would wake up and really understand that Facebook is nothing but the government keeping a super close eye on all its members. Before they took over back in its hey day the idea and functionality of Facebook was okay	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Brilliant app, works really well. Always have updates. Brilliant!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

I have a sick child. We do fundraisers to pay her bills. I pd 4 advertising one of them & NEVER SEEN IT on side of page not once nor did my frnds!!! DONT DO IT other than that I like the app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It takes too long to open links, it needs to be improved.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
You asked the wrong person to rate this poor excuse of an app! Unresponsive, slow and unstable on my and my wife's iPhone 4 and our iPad 2.  Very disappointing and frequently aggravating.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't change profile picture through the phone app I have to use my computer. iPhone 4S	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

When I wanna look at pictures it freeze up, I mean it tends to slow down. If you work out that bug, it would be great.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Slow, slow, slow........I suggest you find another social network. This one data mine for the govt and censors its users	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Really slow, never updates properly, takes FOREVER to do anything and for one of the biggest social networking sites in the world this app is a massive letdown.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The latest version is not as bad as previous ones. Push notifications are working the way they should now and scrolling is faster. Not bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Useless app. The app crashes as it tries to open.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nice way to connect with people and network career opportunities	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The FB app is like any other.. It works, it has quirks occasionally but I use it all the time.. So other than that.. A  few suggestions... a zoom would be nice.. Also a home button where you don't have to back your way out to your feed	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Every time I go look at anyone's page the app crashes on me. :(	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I think on the next update, we should be able to change the cover photo on the timeline:)	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Great just needs the mood option on status update .	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
You can't search your own timeline or history. Bad.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Sticks all the time plus keeps freezing	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Still rating this 2 stars due to the extensive crashing (I had to restart the app 5 times once), lagging and general dislike.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Stop changing something that's perfect already. You are ruining the app.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
As long as you post anti American or that you walked outside, you will have no issues!!! Facebook wants you to be controlled by them and extremists. You are not allowed to think for yourself and comment on your thoughts. They will ban you for speaking your mind!!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still needs a lot of updates:( still crashing.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I liked better before	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I like it much better than my browser. I can share a photo, and go right back to where I was in my newsfeed, The messaging system is much easier and I like how it notifies you when someone likes or comments something of yours. I really do like it!!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love my Facebook app! Easy to access, make arrangements, chat to friends, keep updated with the world when I'm stuck in work. It's social connections at your finger tips that can make life so much easier!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
For start I cannot upload a single video off of any device plus it also is crashing a lot please get it fixed -.-	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
SLOW	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Is great	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Without it I would have much less social interaction with far away relatives & friends which would not be good!! I enjoy most of it except top stories selection it needs to be removed.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Nothing to say	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Crashes a lot. Pictures and comments are hit or miss to open. Might as well just delete this and use the desktop version, hardly even worth it.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Getting better still few issues tho pictures don't load properly sometimes and ye carnt see other messages only normal inbox	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
The app doesn't do everything that it should to using Facebook...you can't often see videos or pictures and currently it just keeps saying updating- but doesn't update...I reset numerous times a week but find that doesn't really help...Messages need better notification and posting pictures or videos is a pain! Uploading, sharing and general use is difficult :( Very Disappointed!	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It seems to get worse with every update. The app freezes and/or crashes way too often. It's gotten to a point to where I have to use safari to do most things on FB mobile.	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not sure what's up but Facebook constantly freezes up on my iPhone 5. Have to uninstall and reinstall to get it working again. I'm not a happy camper!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Horrible. Nothing works since the update was done on my iPhone.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Much better speed and flow and status updates have the face things now!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I do no like how they moved the notifications bar to the bottom of the screen; I find it to be very annoying and out of place. I prefer the layout of the version previous to this one. Please change it back.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
What a piece of crap. Slow, hardly ever loads the data it needs. The lack of landscape mode for commenting on status updates, is stupid. Especially when landscape works when commenting on photos. A developer is asleep at the computer at Facebook. WAKE UP!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This update still doesn't low for the portrait/landscape view when posting messages, or viewing pages...oddly though, it works when viewing pictures. Kind of a stupid thing to overlook.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It crashes when you go into someone's picture album , it's so annoying	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Change it back to where you can turn this stuff sideways to text on Facebook!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Still crap. Even with the update, still unable to see posts by others on liked pages.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Half of my posts And comments disappear. It is very frustrating. I also experience long periods of refreshing before the page actually loads. I believe this to be the Facebook app problem because I don't have a problem with this via the browser. I hope this new update fixes the bugs because other than those problems I do like the app. But, having your posts disappear kind of defeats the purpose of being on Facebook.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I would like to see full support of the events on the ap.  Using the Facebook ap, you can set up an event, but you can't edit any details, add co-host, manage time settings, or even add photos.  Might as well not be able to set an event up in the first place.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Just when u think an App can't get any slower ..... u r updating it - gets worse and worse .... a real pain to even use it anymore! What a shame - the earlier "simpler" version were much better!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
There are some glitches, but it's pretty good. Closing for no reason is the most annoying. Also, you should create an option to make a photo a "cover picture."	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
New update, same rubbish. Still can't see my own posts on pages I like, still can't see comments by others in pages I like. Facebook, you are so lame.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Stop adding features! no one cares! Get the speed going...BY FAR THE SLOWST APP THERE IS!!!Extremely annoying. They could not claim it's due to overuse. Google has just as many, if not, more users and yet works smooth and quick.Highly unimpressed!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It first disappeared from the iPad app a while ago and now it disappeared from the iPhone app as well! Please put this button back so I can see what other people post in the fan pages as I can do on the web version! How hard can that be to bring it back! There has been like 8 updates since it disappeared. How come it has not been fixed yet?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I love the app &' how it's become so easy to use. Especially when I was able to start sharing via mobile. If only we are able to edit where the pictures go in the album such as an order to them, that's would be great. I don't really use my laptop anymore so I hope in later updates I can do this thru my iPhone.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

When I  click on timeline it's only what the page has written :/Who thought this was a Good idea?It's supposed to be social media right?How can it be social if you can't see what anyone had put up?But again rather than fix this you again add pointless things people don't need!!Sigh :,(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I used to be able to go to a friends profile to set the setting to see there post in wall or in my notifications but that option is gone in the app please bring it back also we would like hashtag s so us mobile users can play also thank you	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Most RECENT update, since previous update and review...now can't even login! Wish I could assign a downgrade from previous 1-star review.-------------Terrible. Gets locked up, can't load, and it frequently just crashes, expelling you from the app. Enjoyed it before the update!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It won't update!!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My Facebook app won't load at all! I can leave it loading for 10 minutes and nothing will happen	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Keeps freezing and crashing after update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just downloaded the update. When I opened it after the download, it froze and kept giving me error messages. I had to turn off my phone and restart it and it still gives me error messages. What is wrong with you people??  Every time there is an update, it gets worse and worse. Do you even listen to the users of the app or do you not care?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
All I get now is network errors and crashes. Very disappointing :( easier to just go through safari to Facebook.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Every time you guys update this stupid App it gets slower and slower what is the problem??!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Worked great until update. The FB app worked well in the past. Now it just hangs up and chugs as if it's doing something and ultimately shuts down. Waste of a good blood pressure.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just updated the app and what do you know it's now worse then before ! Very frustrating !	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love the app but it also crashes way too much you NEED to fix this ASAP!!! But other than that it's amazing I have no other problems. So ill rate it at a 3 medium! ;)	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Update is terrible. iP5!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm sick of the app constantly crashing. I just downloaded the new update and it just improved pointless stuff and didn't fix any bugs. This needs to be fixed ASAP. For some reason it always crashes at the worst times like when I'm in the middle of a long message or something. Well get it fixed!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everything loads EXTREMELY SLOWLY on my iPhone 5. Sometimes things fail to load at all. Using LTE, 3G, or even wifi doesn't matter, the app refuses to load half the pages.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's says the network is down	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

So....I updated to the latest version a few minutes ago and now the app will not work at all on either my ipad mini or iPhone 5.  The updating icon just keeps spinning to no avail. Thanks for a terrible update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Nothing will load, freezes, crashes. Poor fix	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I knew I shouldn't have updated the app!! It took me 4 tries to get in the app without getting a plain white screen. Finally saw timeline after multiple "network error" messages. There is nothing wrong with my phone and the app worked right before the update. What did you do FB???	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
We have the return of the never ending spinning circle....really can this app ever go through one update without it crashing itself.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app says I don't have Internet connection when I do and takes forever to load.. Get this app working correctly cause its annoying how it isn't.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I upgraded my app on my iPhone 4 today. Now I keep getting error messages & cannot connect. I thought upgrades were supposed to fix bugs, not cause them!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
You can no longer view albums on 'like' pages from this app. PLEASE FIX ASAP	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
After installing the newest update the app doesn't load up at all. Generally very disappointed with it. Its not very user friendly IMO.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nothing appears in newsfeed since latest update, nothing loads. Pease fix soon.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Latest update seems broken. Won't load my newsfeed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Constant trouble... Ugh	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
News feed wont load properly, and most of my messages won't send!! not acceptable	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This new version is crazy buggy.  At least before I could refresh my own page.  Now the connection doesn't matter (4G, 3G, Wifi)...it won't refresh.  Aren't you guys testing these before you spit them out?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have a few games that use Facebook to login, now Facebook give me a network error after the newest update.I can't play my games!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I think you guys need to go back on the drawing board. FAIL.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Did the latest update and now nothing at all will load. All my connections to the net are fine.Thought updated made things better?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Before this update it crashed every other time I opened it, now it won't even load. This is ridiculous. Each update is just getting worse. Fix it?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is not working for me at all it crashes every like 2 mins its starting to seriously piss me off I have updated it thinking it would help and it didn't honestly I think it made it work you guys make billions of dollars it's an app get your s h i t together and fix this please.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Another horrible update. I can't even get on facebook. It just keeps saying "Network Error". Never had this problem until I did the update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After the last update, I can't log in	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Learn to fix the bugs and glitches before you send out the updates minus one star rating !!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It logged me out when I did the update ad now I can't log back in! You do updates to fix thing or make it "better" and only make it worse!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seriously? I updated the app today. Now it won't update my news feed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So normally things get better with age but unfortunately Facebook only gets worse with each update. Now it doesn't even start up...just a spinning circle 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just DL the new update.  Now FB can not find server.  Please fix now	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook has frozen every time I've tried anything except looking at my news feed, hopefully the next update will improve issues instead of creating them	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just upgraded and now will not run. Forget the upgrade.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Wth Facebook! The last update is not working.. Keep getting network error!!!!! I do like ur app just not now!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Why does it get worse with each "update"?!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After today update, takes so long to log-in, if even..and once logged in it takes so long to load the news feed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
The iPhone app is seriously slow probably due to the ads. I hope FB will fix this flaw!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ugh! So bad. Since the update, it's so slow!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Now when i try to open the latest version it wont even open !!! Just the loading sign greatttt	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time it crashes & takes forever to load	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
One of the worst apps out there.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very slow to get updates. I wait up to 4 minutes some times. Also don't like the ads or their frequency pushed to my news feed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't log in at all after the update. Fix it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ever since the new update today, it keeps giving me a network error and won't connect my candy crush.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I just updated FB and now the app will not work!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Won't go past the loading screen after I updated it. Using an iPhone 4S.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Today's update is just fabulous. Now I can't even open the app. And while you're fixing that bug, maybe allow us to rotate our phones to type into statuses and messages.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Updated facebook now it's horrible!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Update.... Just forced an update today and now the app won't open at all... According to reviews looks like I'm not the only one that this has happened to :(Better than the droid version in my opinion. Smooth and fast, never have connection issues.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Has anyone had a "network error" pop up since updating?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This new update doesn't work. It won't load anything after two restarts of my device. Way to make it worse ...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I have the current update and it crashes a lot and it also says unable to connect to network all the time	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Newest release has too many issues. Just roll it back one version and then try to fix it before releasing it again. Stop making us your beta testers.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
If y'all are going to do an update, make sure it WORKS first ! Keeps crashing.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The newest version had to be deleted and reinstalled after the update after three crashes while opening on my 4S. I liked the less cluttered version from a few updates ago. The chat bubbles get in the way on a small screen. I'm still happy that the share button got added a while back, on the positive side.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Lately it's been so so bad!!! Bugs galore! Sometimes doesn't open.Big problems loading pictures, newsfeed, selecting recent activity or friends doesn't matter.Stopped buffering all the time which is a start. Missing total # of friends in my friends list. Since the last few updates its hard to pull up pictures from your newsfeed. Other than that, making a good step from the original monstrosity that was this app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
It's ok but freezes way to much	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I never write reviews, this is literally my first one but I feel it's warranted. The last update completely broke the app (iPad) and made it rash all the time, rendering it almost unusable. The new update made it even worse by keeping the crashing intact, but adding many other issues like comments not loading, pictures freezing and not loading at all, and unresponsive buttons. I know they're working hard to get things right for everyone and it doesn't always work, and the more they know the better they can make the next version. Keep working Facebook crew, it'll come around	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This upgrade is a failure... Crashes only after you upgrade...	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
New version takes a very long time to show anything.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This App is junk! The safari is faster and doesn't crash every 30 seconds :/	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Stop updating this app. Please. Every time you's do, it never functions properly at all.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand
It's stupid the app is always crashing	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app worked great before I did the update!! Now it keeps giving me a network error when I have full service LTE and on wifi! Won't even refresh! Hope they fix this soon!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Slow, buggy and straight up forgets posts and comments or puts them out of order. As soon as something else comes along, I'm jumping ship.6/18/13 - new update. Now it doesn't work at all. With as much money as Facebook has from farming our data, you'd think they'd at least have a working app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seriously Facebook? Every time there is an update, you fix one thing but everything else gets screwed up. It just doesn't seem like it should be that complicated. Even if you have to start from scratch. Get it right already!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Terrible update. Won't open, won't load things. Messages aren't received in full. Lets fix this mess you've made	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest update 18 June 2013 is very slow now on my iphone 5 and I can't get it to login on my iPad 3 even after a reinstall because it kept timing out after the update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't even get to the login screen now. It won't load. Just sticks on the Facebook splash screen. Tried to uninstall, reinstall, and even restarted the phone. Still nothing.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since update I have not been able to open the app... When it does open it just loads and load and loads.... Nothing changes!!! What's going on here?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes way too much. And freezes.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app was good at first but now it's been crashing a lot and just recently I've been having network errors, I can't even get on the tech support.  I hope you guys are reading these reviews because the Facebook app needs a real update fast.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I just downloaded the new version a few hours ago. Since installing my Facebook has crashed many times and will not load anything properly. I've even deleted and reinstalled. Highly annoying.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't even load a friends page (tried both LGE and wifi!), let alone upload a picture. Major problems to fix Facebook. To add to the ultimate fail, the app support link doesn't work!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Doesn't work at all since update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since Facebook update the app been slow & loads forever to check the news feeds or the notifications.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app gets more and more unstable with each update. I made the mistake of downloading the newest version and now I can't log in! You would think that as much as people use FB the app would work a lot better.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just updated with the 6/18 Facebook update in the Apple App Store. Since updating today, Facebook or any game associated with the Facebook app will not load. It was working perfectly until today's update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Won't even let me log in since I did the update on my iPhone 5. Come on Facebook you think you guys would get with it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Thanks a lot, Fuckerberg. Send out an update that blocks users from your entire program. Brilliant!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Forget the new features. Try making something that works. After waiting 5 minutes for my newsfeed to load (it still hasn't loaded and yes, I actually timed it) I decided to come and tell you that you still fail and still merit zero stars.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just updated the app and now it won't load posts past 3 hours or anyone's page. The last update was perfect :/. If I could, I'd redownload it rather than have nothing load.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

After this recent update, the feeds take an extremely long time to refresh. Actually, everything takes a long time to refresh!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Latest update- Fail!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest version(3.3.3) will not allow photo uploads from my iPhone 4. This has been happening for weeks and restarting the phone doesn't fix it. The app is still missing some basic functions of the web site. At this point you would think they could have figured this out.UPDATE (v4.1.1): if I could give this app less than one star, I would. It's horrible. Loading the first screen after launch sometimes takes over a minute. Never less than 20 seconds. Everything it does is painfully slow and buggy.UPDATE (v6.2): I don't know how they do it, but with every new version, the engineers at Facebook somehow manage to make this app more crash-prone than the last. Still launches slow as molasses. Still locks up when I attempt to set the display in my News Feed to "Most Recent" (which it never remembers from one session to the next). I hate this app with the heat of ten thousand suns.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If I wasn't obsessed with Facebook I would not have this app. It is ridiculously slow. Every update just makes it even slower! The time it takes to load, i could have turned on my laptop and opened facebook faster! It doesn't send me notifications, unless it is those stupid "add my birthday" things. It crashes all the time, too. This app needs a lot of work.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the update, both iPhone/iPad Candy Crush Saga can't connect to FB. No game for me tonight...

Facebook app won't even load feed now. iPhone 5 user. Facebook WAS great when it was birthdays, status updates and photo/vid sharing. Now there is too much other "extras" (junk). I'd swap to something else in a heartbeat if so many of my friends and family weren't FB users.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I should have known to install the Facebook update as each time it's disastrous, page won't load up, pic albums won't load up....etc!!! ZERO STARS, doesn't matter anyhoo, I'm fazing Facebook out, soon to be Facebook-less. It's ran it's course.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I like the idea of an update but I think we should get to see what it will look like first as I don't like how all mine has changed at all and we should be able to go back to the old look if we want to.. It was better before this new update	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I'm not sure how its possible, but whoever does these "updates" keeps making the app worse..  How about instead of adding new features focus on CONNECTIVITY.  I'm pretty sure that should be common sense since this is a SOCIAL NETWORK APP...  Seriously, this is getting ridiculous..  It's easily the slowest loading app out there.  FIX IT NOW PLEASE..	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Iphone 4: You basically download this app by default if you have a Facebook, but it is a terrible app considering the producer. The app crashes at least once, if not two or three times, every time I open it. If I slide to unlock a notification the app crashes. Probably one out of every ten uses the app crashes randomly while I am using it. While viewing pictures the app tend to crash a lot more frequently. Long story short, I prefer using a bookmarked web page to view my Facebook. For a billion dollar company you think they could produce an app that does its job.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't even get it to load after downloading the update. Have uninstalled until a fix comes.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

App worked fine before today's update.After the so-called update, I keep getting a Network Error when I try to connect. Tried on 3G and Wifi but no dice. I then removed the app, hard booted the phone and reinstalled the app but same issue. I have an iPhone 4, with the latest OS updates so my phone is not the issue. This app is complete crap. And so is Facebook.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
ever since I updated the app doesn't load a thing. No bueno.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time Facebook updates this app, it gets worse!The last couple of updates caused it to freeze and/or crash every couple of minutes. This latest update included the very useful feature of a network error every time it refreshes.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes so much now that it is completely unusable. I literally can't even open the app now after it's most recent update. This is not my phone as all my other apps run smooth.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm having issues with logging back in. I don't know if I'm the only one, but Facebook is one of the main things I use my phone for and not being able to log on is a problem	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
After the newest update, Facebook won't even load on my iPhone 5.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

It doesn't want load bad all	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The two biggest and most conplained-about problems with the previous updates were the remarkably slow loading and the constant crashing. FaceBook decided to remedy this by making an update that crashes just as much and runs even slower. Additional features mean nothing if one cannot even get the app to work long enough to use them.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just updated, now nothing will load and my newsfeed wont update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Update led to news feed not updating. When I try to update news feed it says network error even after I've checked my network.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Crashes at least 3 out of 5 times on the iphone5. Would expect a little better from a company as large as fb.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I always pictured Facebook as an app that was good. As I use it, I notice there are many errors. First, my newsfeed doesn't get updates from some of my close friends, yet feeds many profiles of friends whom I am not even close with.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Needs to be fix this app its a &‰âÂ@&('	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest update won't show notifications.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Not able to open notification or emotions need a fix to the upgrade.....	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Regret updating. Things aren't loading. Why is everything at the bottom of the app now? Don't fix what isn't broken. But for the love of god fix this.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app but it keeps on crashing since the update they sent me earlier	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
This is the worst update for this app thus far! Now I have no access to my own wall other than profile picture and cover photo. And it says my photos are unavailable. I think this app has crashed 5 times in the four hours I've updated it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I downloaded the recent update and I see no changes!  My husband updated his and he sees changes.  I tried logging out and logging in and still nothing.  I even deleted it off my phone and added it and still no changes that I can see.  What am I do doing wrong!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This latest update and the last previous one are awful. The app keeps freezing and then it crashes numerous times on the iPhone...please sort this out!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This update is a fail. Takes too long to load news feed. DO NOT UPDATE.  This update version is GARBAGE!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
New version just downloaded. Now it does nothing but spin and spin. Worthless. Horrible.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Keeps crashing since the update today.... Come on!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Basically they had a really cool tab on the side you swiped to get and a familiar look and feel, now it looks like every other wannabe chat services. Why Facebook, pick a design and leave it	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
I love FB but its SO SLOW! And forces close on me all the time. Hardly ever let's me see the latest news feeds.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is always logging me out and I have to restart.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Please fix this it's so slow and my profile is not loading, the update just made it worse	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
iPhone 4 user & after today's update, it STILL takes forEVER to open. Ho-hum. Still want Most Recent as default, especially since it takes do long to load. Just more frustrating to have to select Most Recent after waiting for it to open; then have to wait all over again while it sorts into most recent. Grrrr	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
How is it with every update it gets worse? I can't share what I'm feeling/watching etc. just sits there and says loading. Looks like I'm going back to the web version "/	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Loaded new update an hour ago and since then, it's taken me an hour to post an update; the app keeps freezing; and if it isn't freezing, it crashes.  Good job!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Your looking thru photos and then it turns off and takes you to your home screen , needs to be fixed and stop crashing all the time	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	New Zealand
It crashes too many times and with the new update, it takes too long to log into my account as well as loading newsfeed and uploading picture. So far, this is a piece of crap	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Won't open after most recent update	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It just updated a few hours ago on my 4s, now it's not working.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Since the latest update the app won't load. Leave stuff alone Facebook!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Did the update and now nothing will load. Uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted iPad and nothing shows up. I let it sit for five minutes and nothing happens.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Was able to open Facebook for a minute but couldn't access my profile or my photos or any of my apps. I uninstalled and reinstalled and now it won't even let me log in! What's going on?!?!?!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nothing will load! I've rebooted my phone and closed out all my apps. This is ridiculous! :-(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With the latest update, the app doesn't open any more.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everything was good until I updated today. Take forever to load and keeps crashing. iPhone 5	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Since the update earlier today, my news feed wont load and I can't do anything. Way to go!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Can't login. Can't update when I was logged in.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nothing loads, if and when it does it is slow and takes way too long!! Still not get my notifications. I thought updates were supposed to help not make things worse?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is getting slower and slower with each update.  I wish they would fix the half baked photo upload rather than adding in more sparkles that don't work.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Won't allow me to refresh. And if it does decide to it takes 20 minutes to do so.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Used to be good. Now it crashes all the time. Somedays doesn't even open. Useless!!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
What a disaster. App won't load with new update on June 18th.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Says all the time that I have Internet problems while my Internet Is working fine!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I can't even see my news feed or even my own timeline. Is there an update that actually works like it should!?!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
With all that money Facebook has coming in, you would think they could find someone to make a descent, working app for iPhone. The app never reloads and freezes constantly. I'm better off going to the website through safari.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just got notice that there was an update to my Facebook app about an hour ago. Haven been able to log in or link my games since then. I guess we'll be seeing an update to the update before too long. I did like the app before this.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The last update (did it a few minutes ago) did not work. The app did not refresh!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can't even load news feed on this new update please fix	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Constantly crashing, or won't load at all!!  Unable to use landscape mode now.  Constant error messages in different features!!  Ugh.... Please hurry and fix the bugs or lets go back to previous mode.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I had to try logging on four times before the new version would let me in. But the real issue is the new friends page. What happened to the alphabet scroll tabs on the right side?? I don't want to have to search for a specific friend, or have those delete buttons there all the time. Bring the scroll tabs back or you will find me on here a lot less....	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Another update creates different problems.  Same old story.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

today i updated mi facebook app and chat is not working at all, who tested it?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Is the new update some form of a downgrade, because the features I used to enjoy, I AM not enjoying. First it slowed app loading (the most obvious difference) & it crashed once (that never happened before). I thought it was my iPhone 5, but I didn't noticed any difference with my other apps.  Fix everything.......or bring it back to the previous version	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

So tired of getting updates that just make it work worse!! Maybe instead of updating once a week they should get the update right and do it once a month! Freaking Mark Zuckerburg!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Works 30% of the time. Can't even log in right now. Can't see my videos. Freezes all the time. Yay.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Crashes, failure to "connect" even when using wifi, will not load any pictures or statuses let alone profiles. Overall terrible app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just updated this app and it will it load anything.  Don't update your app if you don't have to.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's so bad now that they updated it !!! It would load my news feed I hate it so much please fix it and don't update the app trust me !!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It won't let me look at comments on pictures and my IM box takes forever to show who is online and it also keeps crashing my iPad Mini	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Horrible update! Won't even open now!!!! Instead if updating an adding features maybe fix ones that are already there and don't work. I am DONE with Facebook. Deactivating NOW.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Just did the most recent update and I keep getting "network error" even after restarting phone several times. Terrible update since the app isn't even working properly now.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I can't do anything now since the app updated	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Really slow & crashes all the time now after it had been working well for quite a long time. And honestly, who cares if you can add "‰ÛÓfeeling happy " onto your statuses. I don't. Just slows it down.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seems like at least most of the issues have been addressed on this new update... It is working smoother (I hope don't jinx it). I will give you guys 4 stars for now... might go up to 5 or down back to 0... hope you stay at 5 this time	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I try to log in but it stays loading and loading wth!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
How about you actually test the build before you deploy it? Your latest version crashed 7 times after updating and now no longer updates the time. I just get to enjoy watching the spinning wheel.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The application is very intuitive and things are easy to fine.  The problem arises when you click on pictures, the app tends to hang for four to five seconds for the picture loads.  This problem is only with showed up in the recent updates.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
My all doesn't even open now because of this new update. Please fix!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Doesn't even work now that it's updated.  Opens but just continues to load. DO NOT UPDATE!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I've had Facebook installed since the day I got an iPhone, but I deleted it today. Update after update comes, yet nothing improves. It continues to freeze every time I open a photo, and I still don't have a way to change the privacy settings of a pot after I have posted it. Plus, I don't see half the posts I do when viewing the website. And we're all still waiting for the new newsfeed that is supposed to streamline viewing between mobile and web. I'm just done.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have iOS 6 on a iPhone 4S and the app won't even load data. It has never done this. The application is very unstable on my device after update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just updated my Facebook for iPad, primer to updating I had no problem with the page refreshing and viewing comments to my posts, but now it just sets there as I watch the little ring spine around and around and not loading.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Freezes when you load an image. Just get a black screen on my 4s. Does nothing after that. Extremely slow in loading. Like previous reviewer said.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So so	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Can't log on after todays update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not pleased with the last update, the advertisements, the messaging system, its slow to react when you try to look at a pic in a post, scrolling lags and sometimes freezes. Now on June 18th this update is way worse. Very slow, freezes, states unable to load tap here to retry and when u tap....nothing happens. Just can't leave good alone. Facebook App has steadily gone down hill over last year. Time to change social networking i guess.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can no longer upload photos!!!!! Please fix!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Your update is super fail... This happens all the time. What a waste of time.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok. Seriously. Stop updating it. The point of an *update* is that us FIXES the problems. Not ruin it more.Why are you BIGGOTS even *updating* it? Why? Why? WHY? Before V5 it was good. No bugs needed to be fixed or anything.'Lets screw things around ahue ahue'	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

New update needs to be fixed. Now my Facebook app won't even update on my IPhone 5. Please fix ASAP. Will change my rating when fixed	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Yes every freaking week! You don't need any updates, it's all good, there is nothing wrong with it except for annoying updates. Twitter app doesn't do this so much, look up to them. Another thing, it's always just fine until u update it again, so when it's good, don't update it. If u ever think about updating again, make sure every bug is fixed and this update has no bugs, test it first	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Enough said.  Test updates before releasing them, Facebook!  Had to downgrade back to 6.0 :/	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update is making the app crash and loading super slow please fix soon.. 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Nice update today.  You've made the news feed useless.  It's frozen.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After I installed the latest update, none of my comments I write stay on the post. The comments will show up as soon as I post them. Go back to look at it later and it's gone again.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App won't load on iPhone 5 after new update. How was this not tested?? Tried on LTE, 4G, and wifi. Uninstalled and reinstalled, turned off and on. Nothing.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
- No landscape keyboard.- 'Most recent' option now have to select each time I go back to News Feed section.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Considering the size and scope of Facebook, I can not believe how terrible this app is. It's slow, crashes all of the time, and STILL does not allow me to type in landscape. It should be illegal for any app that requires typing to not allow typing in landscape when the keyboard is up. It's impossible to type in portrait orientation. Fix this!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After a while facebook for iphone became very very slow. Sometimes it takes about 10 seconds to do any action and fot this tine the UI is frozen.It became really hard to use. Amount of ads is crazy: 1 ad per 1 friends update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I couldn't even get this new update to load. I removed the app and now I can't get the whole thing to download! These updates are ridiculous!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Please update so that I can keep my friends from seeing what i like/comment on thats on someone else's page besides theirs or mine. When I comment or like a picture on 1 person's page, I don't need all my friends seeing it. Also, I don't care to see what some of them like/comment on. I mean, their regular posts be cool, but that extra is getting on my nerves. Please update as quick as you can little engineers that could. 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

After an update! My Facebook app is exactly the same. It will not change at all. Yet if I login to any other account, it's already updated!! FIX IT please!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Can't even sign in. Just loads and then says error.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Doesn't sync with contacts or calendar anymore. What's up with that?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Being that you are focused on mobile your app is terrible yet okay. Number one add landscape - if Messenger can do it so can this app. The new layout is terrible! Also another really annoying thing is that I never get push notifications anymore when I have them enabled. Fix this please! Crashes happen periodically and are annoying. ONLINE STATUS FOR DEAR GOD THEY NEVER ARE ACCURATE. THIS IS SUCH A NUISANCE - JUST NO. And photos are forever taking to load (not normal). Oh and I would give this a 2.5.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Please add a post picture button on the comments I always wanted to do that but I only could post faces please add it!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Can't connect to Facebook with this latest update. Every attempt leads to a "Network Error" error message. I've had no problems with the previous versions.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I swear to god if you don't issue an update with bug fixes for this app I'm dumping Facebook entirely.  It constantly crashes and functions clunky at best.  There are other social media outlets.  F'n fix yours or I'm dumping it.  And getting a large response to a status update to that effect.  What the hell is your problem?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Updates for what they dont do anything same ol things over and over how about adding a unfollow button cause i hate posting on someones status only to be going on forever ..'!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate the stupid chat bubble thing, I highly prefer the black bar at the bottom.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I am ready to say good bye to Apple Products because they keep making a stable program more complicated and less reliable	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Just updated the app and now my FB won't even open. Total bummer.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I do NOT like the new update, I wish it still had the four icons at the bottom of the screen. :(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can yo make this app more like the htc facebook phone	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I log in & instead of swiping to the left to get to my profile, events, pages, etc. I get this black bar at the bottom which says News Feed, Messages, Contacts, Notifications and more, which is annoying and not the correct format	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
After I installed the update u just release I open my fb and start to talk to people and it still crashes....it's not my iPad its ur app. FIX IT!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am havin a hard time downloading the new update for facebook on my phone I tried it a couple times but it quits when its half way done	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The newest update won't even start up.  Why can't you people leave well enough alone? The app continues to crash and now you changed the layout of home pages to where people can't access photo pages anymore. I used to be able to access different albums of different liked pages and now I can only see recent photos.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
6.2 -Still unacceptable. Start composing a comment. Minimize the app, bring back the app and the comment vanishes. This did not happen in prior versions. I reported this in 6.1. Facebook developers did not fix it. They must cease all new development until existing features are restored. 6.1.1 - Still unacceptable. New bug. Start composing a comment. Minimize the app, bring back the app and the comment vanishes. This did not happen in prior versions. Facebook, fire your developers and suspend all new feature development until you fix all the defects in the current version. Make what you already have work and stop breaking things. 6.0.2 - View previous comments fixed. Add a comment thread to a Group and it double posts until it updates at some point.  Of course, now updates take forever. Click a posted picture and 90% of the time this version will crash. Again, I call for the firing of Facebook's incompetent programming staff. Your users are not your beta testers. 6.0.1 Broke the "View Previous Comments" feature on long message threads. It works the first time you visit the long thread and tap it. But, when more are added after that point, you can only see the first 10 and last 10 comments with no way of loading all the ones in between. Didn't anyone test this before release?  Worthless. Useless. Round up your programmers Facebook and fire them. 5.5 Intolerably slow and buggy. I cannot use it reliably. Fix it!5.5 Slowest updates yet. Fire your incompetent programming staff Facebook. 5.2.1 Notifications feature is still broken. That's three strikes in a row. Toss your programmers out, FB and stop treating your users like guinea pigs. A possible workaround for the Notifications defect. Log into the Desktop (not the Mobile) website and reset the Notification count to zero there. Sheesh. 5.2. The count in Notifications is still never accurate. I finally learned if I go to my profile, I can delete an errant post. Amazingly counter-intuitive and inconsistent design. Fire the software development team. Another disaster. I've had to hard reset my iPhone at least twice because of this buggy update.  Tagging is broken (still). The notifications feature is now completely unstable. I keep getting notifications of status updates I've already read. Update to the update. Tagging sometimes works. It's still unacceptably buggy. Now, pasting something to a message I've started will cause the message to be cut off at the insertion point. I can't Remove a post on my status update either. I have to log in via Safari, tap-sweep right and tap Remove. This used to work in the app and they broke it again. When is Facebook going to hire some testers?Another update. Still no tagging. When is Tagging ever going to work in the app?I can tag in the Desktop Site version through Safari, but now the Groups feature broke on the iPhone Safari Desktop Site version. Facebook has to fix these things.Oh, and in the latest update, some of my settings were reset yet again.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I am sick to death of Facebook crashes! My phone has almost ended up smashed a few times from your inability to make an app that actually works fluidly . I have deleted and redownloaded many times! sick of it freezing too! your app is atrocious! pull your head in!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I would like to be able to use it in "lancape mode " for my iPhone 5, :(And another thing I am NOT HAPPY is: I cannot select/ choose between my already exist albums of photos to upload more pictures to them. ( just let me choose between a couple,..... Exactly the ones I'm not looking for) :'(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So still no landscape mode for typing?So instead of one app for everything I pretty much HAVE TO have Facebook Messenger as well so I can type in landscape?Facebook, what happened to you?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app crashes alot, unless you are patient, just go on safari or google to get into your Facebook it is better on there.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have a few minor complaints about Facebook in general, such as the annoying ads, and the new feature that allows people my friends have followed to appear in my news feed, but on the next update of the app I would love to be able to disable the "show in newsfeed" option for my friends and pages.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Please fix this problem. Keeps crashing after a second of launching it.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Still cannot view recent post by others on liked pages like we could before the last update. FIX THIS!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is totally useless and gets more lame every update. Constant freezing, crashing and just being overall slow. Stop adding useless icons and just fix the speed, crashing and freezing problems. I just don't understand how hard it could be to make a stable app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest update only shows a few of the most recent updates then jumps back to yesterday.  Ridiculous!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Cool	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Yo Facebook! App crashes when updating the news feed? Network error even though I have LTE? You guys would get a one star if I couldn't actually use the app. Get it together and make your app useful with iOS! Jeez	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's annoying that when you're scrolling through messages it closes because of the new update	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It has been trying to update for over an hour!! Get it together!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Diggin the new layout. However, it's a pain that I have to constantly switch the status updates to "recent." If I always want to see the most recent, I shouldn't have to always re-select it. Also annoying is that whenever I get notifications in the groups I follow, when I open the page, there's no recent posts shown. Makes no sense!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The interface is complicated	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
It crashes alot we needa fix it ASAP	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook is acting up it the chat heads our not poping up its Not showing the mesges it's not working good every since I update it	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My messages won't update. They either say active now, active now but says 1m, or active 1+hours. It no longer says like active 15m ago..if this makes sense. Fix it, this is annoying! Other then that..works fine	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Often crashes on this version, hoping for a fix	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Great update to the bugs found in version 6.1. The app is now fully functional and more importantly, usable. "Animation" sequences (opening chat heads, photos, etc) no longer freezes.Still hoping, however, to be able to delete comments/posts within the app one day.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This update looks cool and nice and faster	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
LANDSCAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Morons who program this app. Why are you so stupid!?!? LANDSCAPE ORIENTATION IS BASIC FUNCTIONALITY IN IOS. It was there initially! Why would you take it away???? And the new version moves things all over the place. It doesn't match the online version. What are you thinking???	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I use daily... All day. Not loving the crashes or when I write a comment & it doesn't post... Seems to vanish in thin air. Otherwise, LOVE this app-it's my fav & most used! please make it easier to "unshow" people from newsfeed from mobile version. Thank you for always making improvements!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Thank you!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
takes up a lot of space, I don't know why... It feels like it should e so simple, yet it takes up a ton of space and is really slow. No apparent increase in speed from data to wifi. I don't look to this app in order to reach my friends, which is what facebook is about isnt it? Really didn't step it up with this app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Why'd you switch back to the old navigation? I so much preferred when you could switch want screen you wanted to be on (news feed, home page, etc) on the bottom now it's back to the old upper left corner.. Not as easy/nice layout..	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Wow you just took 2 steps back.  Absolutely ruined the GUI. Stupid cant be fixed with you people.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app gets progressively worse with every update!  I thought it was my phone but its the crappy quality of the app.  The last time my phone took less than 30 seconds to update my news feed was last winter!!!  Then when I tap in most recent, it gives me news from a week ago. Really Facebook?  Get with the program!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I use facely and my face now. Awful.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ok so it seems that the crashing & lack of updating is not getting better with this new version unfortunately I'm still missing post that are able to be viewed online. As well I went to share a pic on a friends timeline & the post button does not work!! I got asked to do a survey by Facebook when I opened the app. So I clicked it & it crashed. Then it was gone. It's got so many bugs that never get fixed!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
How about instead of giving updates to change stupid icons you give updates to actually fix the problems! Like taking, forever to load anything, or just unexpectedly shutting down, or duplicating statuses.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's great communicating with family and friends either by chatting or video chat, but it crashes too much both on iPad and iPhone. Please update with bug fixes.  Uploading pictures can still be a hassle at peak times.  Would love to get more privacy back!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes allllllllll the time.. Super slow... Freezes then crashes... It's like it's being ran by a bunch of senior citizens.. You'd think with all the MONEY FB is cashing in that they could have a really good reliable app... C'mon zuckerburg!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Just updated to the June 18th release.My news feed now only show the first 20 stories. Won't load any more. (The friends feed and following feed do.)	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
6.2 *Still* lacks portrait mode support.  Can't use a landscape keyboard, plus anyone who uses a keyboard case is stuck turning their head sideways to use Facebook. Usability fail. Comments on pics are now unresizable and kind of a joke to try to read too. Landscape does still work for pics, and oddly you can comment on pics in landscape... But $deity forbid you want to post a status horizontally because you have big thumbs. 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app doesn't even deserve one star! It crashed literally every ten freaking seconds! It can't even stay up for five minutes! It is the most frustrating app EVER!! I also freezes and I just hate it SOO much!!! You might as well go on the Internet instead!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate that I have to constantly select "most recent" to see all posts in my news feed. This wasn't the case in the older versions. I just want to be able to come on Facebook and see all my friends posts in chronological order without having to always select "most recent"... And then have to wait 10 seconds for the slow app to respond.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok I like the app.. But it crashes way too much and it's annoying. I could be in a middle of a conversation, writing... Then, gone, the app crashes.. I don't know why but they need to fix that. I have to go on the computer to be on Facebook that's how much this app crashes. I don't know if its just my luck or others are experiencing the same thing but I'm just about ready to delete this app.. I'm hoping the developers could come up with an update that will address this problem because its frustrating..	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The app is so extremely slow, I can hardly even use it anymore. Profiles never load, and it takes minutes for anything at all to load when I open the app. It gets slower with each update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is the only app that doesn't work right on my iPhone 5. Extremely annoying. Never plays videos or opens pictures. POS APP	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

All the new features are great, however you should take a look on the really annoying bugs! Specially the one the makes the app crash all the time!Thank you!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
I like that they updated that you can show emotion status updates.. But dislike that the layout of the chat , timeline and options were in bottom of screen on app ... It needs to get switched back ASAP didn't think that was going to be changed its easier accessible	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Horrible app. Crashes EVERY time I go on it. Can't even use it anymore!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I never opted for timeline, it happened on its own. Facebook must have some advantage for this happening, because there would be an option to go back to the old format.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebook use to be fine and good. NOW it's complete trash :/ its confusing and I don't like it at all! Change it back to when the notifications thing are at the top! I'm so use to that! Now its just confusing.....	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'll admit, things have started getting better and the redesign is growing on me.  I simply wish that you could watch HD videos.  I have also had issues with things being a bit laggy even on my new iPad 4th Gen, and my iPhone 5.  If these could be fixed, I wouldn't mind the app, and I'm glad their trying to improve it!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

On the latest update, Facebook is extremely slow taking over five minutes just to load a page or the news feed. It crashes several times while loading and crashes immediately after reopening the app. It's also missing new features that were supposed to be in this latest update. Probably the worst Facebook update yet. I'd give it 0/5.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Really sick of this. I haven't been able to use Facebook for almost a week now. I'll just use the Internet on my phone. Nothing will load, can't see pictures, an it crashes constantly. Uninstalling.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have a job and a life, which is why I keep chat disabled. The new update includes "Chat Heads," an infuriating chat bubble system that is annoying and obtrusive. There is no way to disable this "feature." Meanwhile, battery drain increases to 1% every 3 minutes on standby. Reverting to the previous release solved the issue. Avoid this travesty like the plague.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's way to slow to load up my news feed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am quite surprised by this change, when I first updated it was the nice column format. Still was even after, but after awhile it changed.

Keeps telling me there is one notification, yet I'm unable to find a recently not yet seen notification. PLEASE consider providing a landscape viewing option. Thanks.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This is CRAP! My FB Icon is Completely Gone and the only way to login is thru web browser.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have only had this app for 2 hours.  In that time this app crashes seems like anytime I want to share something.  It freezes and does not let you see your entire wall.  You can't scroll down after a certain point it is all greyed out and doesn't load the rest of the page.  When I have gone to a friends page only shows you their profile pic.!  Never have I had this much problems with any Facebook app!  Facebook please fix this now!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook for iPhone is like a drunk driver - constantly crashing.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Laughably slow, constantly freezes, delivers half the news feed. I expect a lot more from a company of this magnitude. It is almost unusable	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Great app just wish they would put landscape mode back plz plz plz put landscape mode back	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It dosnt feel like Facebook anymore. Put the icons back at the top. It just looks like a cheap ugly version.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slower than molasses. Crashes way to much. Says I have notifications, messages, & friend requests when I really don't.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Yes, it crashes a lot, freezes, loads very slowly a lot... But my biggest complaint is that when I want to type any kind of text, whether it be a status update, comment, search, or whatever, I can't turn my phone sideways for much more optimal, speedy typing. That bugs the heck out of me!!! (On my iPhone 4)	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The black notification pane on the bottom is annoying. And the chat bubbles? Even more annoying.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Thx . This update is great	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It takes me about 4 tries just to open the app without it crashing, then I can barely do anything on it without crashing. All the images and info on the newsfeed takes forever to load. If I scroll through it before it's done loading, the app crashes; if I let it sit there and wait for it to finish loading, it crashes. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT IT CRASHING!!! >:(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok app, but sometimes when I post a comment on someone's status it will stay a second and then disappear. Does anyone else have this issue?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Updating the features does not necessarily improve the user experience. App is still slow and crashes often.Btw, the Messages tab and the chat heads are redundant.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This Facebook app it's full of crashes, if you guys are going to do something, do it right	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It worked well until the update because my app got erased somehow. I just updated it and didn't touch it. Now when I try to install it, it just says Open. But when I press open nothing happens.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Within about, the last 3 months, the Facebook app has been randomly closing down itself constantly! And it freezes all the time. plz fix this if possible! :(	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia

News feed keeps randomly going back to the top when reading through it. Need the ability to set newsfeed to "Most Recent" ONLY!So the update on 19/6/13 did NOT fix these issues! Ace! (Sarcasm)	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

it's a good app to have so I don't always need to go on my laptop and its quite fast but whenever I get a push notification saying I have a message and go onto it it crashes my app when I've just typed back say a massive paragraph! that's the only thing I hate	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
The app crashes every time I'm on. News feed u can't do anything, comment like or share. If it has a photo u can't event look at it cuz the app crashes. I can't search people or it crashes. I HATE this new app. Can't use it at all!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I know the app will never be close to the desktop version but WOW! The ads are annoying and "suggested" apps are too. The order of "most recent" posts are ridiculous! How can I have a status listed first if it was posted 2 hours ago..followed by one supposedly sent 1 minute ago? Fail. iOS 6 on 4S. Dissatisfied.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

If I'm on my iPhone and I get a Facebook message that pops up near the top of my phone, if I click it, it brings me to a blank Facebook app and about after 5 seconds it shuts it off. Also, even just clicking the Facebook app button, it sometimes takes a few times of clicking it before it actually stays open and loads properly. Please fix because I love FB	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Can't look at comments. Slow to refresh, if at all.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm ready to smash my phone to pieces every time fb tells me I need to continue to update my info. Like every single detail of my life, my phone number, address, exactly what I studied at school.. Etc... If I wanted to share that info I would do it on my own. Sick of being hackled leave me the F alone already!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
We need a Dislike button that after so many dislikes the comment or photo will be removed .. Add the option to let us be able to add photos to conversations after they've been started.. Thanks	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It is impossible to change your cover photo using the app. I can easily change my profile pictures, but there is no option for cover photos.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Freezes too much. I just quit using it. It wasted too much of my time.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Friends that I choose t get notified of their status updates goes away after 2 wks and I have to go back on the COMPUTER and redo it all again. This app is horrible. Get your sh*t together, Facebook!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I use it every day	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I have no idea what has been coded, but the app is quite slow and it is crashing a lot. The prior app was way better.Crash crash crash slow slow slow...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
-Photos zoom in so you miss the edges. -Needs a prompt on home screen for birthdays. -Tagging photos isn't always possible until you click off and on again. -If you use Facebook for a business and tag a lot of photos it flags up on security settings and blocks you. -Needs an iPad update as it's still running on iPhone app	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Obviously your market is everyone! So, I'm guessing the iPad app cannot keep up with so much on the page...I purposely close all apps first before I open FB to prevent crashing.  This does work, but only for awhile.       I do love pages and the versatility and the way other sites can interact with it.  Privacy settings are a great help. Sometimes too much is too much.     You get four because there's really nothing else out there to compare it to.   It's where my friends are.  That's the whole point right?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It force closes at times for no reason. The news feed never seems to stay in the setting you choose?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Since the last update I don't like much espesially when I'm writing messages and  a friend replies as well as when i log on, I don't like the bubble notification of a friend when they wrote me a message!......they should've left it at the top left were the other notifications are.......These options should be available on both. Computer AND the ipad!Using my ipad:               I can't delete specific messages; I can't block specific friends on chat; I would like more smiley faces and little pictures/symbols whatev you call them; with our status we should be able to post what mood we are in.......we should be able to choose a mood that already has the smiley....BUT also be able pick our own smiley/symbol/picture AND be able to type our mood in, with no letter limits, so we can type more than one word!!!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Well it used to work perfectly fine but since it's last update my newsfeed hasn't refreshed and won't refresh.. I'm currently viewing posts from when I last updated which is soo annoying! I've tried many things to get it to refresh but now nothing loads, including my page or anyone elses. Sooo frustrating, I recommend not updating !!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
The app was working perfectly for me.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Since last update around June 18th it crashes. I go into it and it doesnt refresh. Just keeps "thinking" and never updates. Also I REALLY REALLY wish you can use Facebook in landscape mode!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app constantly closes out randomly at any point, also doesn't always show my notifications even when they are on. The notifications that do pop up are never the right amount that I have. I personally think this app is terrible and very frustrating especially when your trying to do something and it just closes. Also pictures sometimes do not load, and when I click on pictures sometimes it closes out the application.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

For theist part it's not to bad   Put could use some work. It closes on you for no reason and it loses you place a lot when messaging people it just shuts down. When looking up things on the Internet it gets info not related to what you were wanting u have to go thru a bunch of it to find what your looking for but all to it just depends on how you use it as to the problems or bigs r in it  would be super nice if it was fix for everything  but it takes time. I love me apple this is the 5th apple iPhone I have own apple is kool iny book. Keep trying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I like the update! I keep getting the wrong no. On the fb icon, it'll have 12 on the icon, open it and there is 7. What the heck?? Also, I can't see the number of friends someone has. I use to be able to see that, when curious.   I'd like to have  a favorite page for business page.  Overall I like the improvements! I'm really excited about changing my profile cover pic on my iPhone. Keep the updates on the ease of use and I'll be a happy guy.  4-26-13 the upgrades are much better! I live the new messenger. I still have a issue with the numbers of comments being correct.  I'd like to see you upgrade the ability to see birthdays. It's a little cumbersome now.6-21-13. The latest upgrade is good. I use the mobile app the most. I like the lower bar, and ease of use. I hope in the future upgrades you make birthdays more accessible, I find it still to be a pain to look up daily.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This app takes foreverrrrrr to update my feed. Most of the time when I get on it in the morning after not being on all night it won't even open it crashes bc it can't update. It's been this way for months and every time there is an app update I think yes finally they will fix the problem... Nope they just add stupid stuff like chat heads. Fix the problems you have Facebook instead adding more stuff to bog it down	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I love facebook but it seems to crash more now that its changed. Whats with this ??	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I'd have to say this is one of the most frustrating apps I have ever used! It's definitely crashbook!!!! It crashes frequently and the app is true slow. It's not my phone either. I at times have to use safari just to get something done on my Facebook so I know right then and there its the app!!! Come on mark z u created FB from a dorm room do something better with the app please and thank u very much!!!June 21 - now the share attachment won't work....stating there is an error!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I primarily use a list to view what I find important because the news feed is highly inaccurate and overwhelming. This update ruins this by bugging out and switching to News Feed every time I open it, which often causes unforeseen issues. Additionally, the new message system should be voluntary; it's more annoying than anything else. Look, this stuff worked fine before. Why change it?Oh, and if I wanted to have updates notify me, I'd have set it up to do so. As I don't want to, STOP TELLING ME HOW.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Why bother to update something in such a way that makes it far less user friendly and far more irritating to use?Now when I avoid the app, due to it being as responsive as a 6 week old tomato, I can't even use safari without it prompting me to use the app. Terrible!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
When I go to my notifications and click on one to see the comment, the comment isn't showing up. Just shows the person's name. I've restarted my phone and didn't help. Also, the app never stays on "most recent" posts. Always returns to "news feed," which is not the way I wish to view people's posts. Today, when I do sort by most recent, it isn't updating. It's showing posts from several hours ago, but when sorted by news feed it shows posts from less than an hour ago.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Why is the news feed jacked up right now?  It starts off with the most recent & then skips about 3 hours of postings. I don't like how we have to keep selecting "most recent" every time I open the app. Is there a way we can set & save our news feed preferences instead of having to select it from the drop down menu every time we open the app?  Otherwise I love it!  Thanks.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This app is stupid crashes shows blank pages shuts its down whenever it wants only displays a few of my pages. Seriously facebook? Get better program.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It alway exprie. I hate it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Awful, gets worse with every update. 'Last seen time' on chat isn't accurate and says I'm online when I'm not. **updated review*** AGAIN, crap update. Can't seem to go on other people's profile as it won't load properly/can't see some comments. I've JUST downloaded it... I'm sure there are lots more wrong with it, however these are the two already annoying things I've noticed thus far. Sort it out! Facebook is some people's mostly used app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I love using Facebook on my phone it's a nice fast way to skim all my friend's posts.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app is pitiful. One reason I bought an IPad was to do the things I love. This has been a huge disappointment.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Very buggy!...posting something with a picture is a crapshoot. You never know if its going to post. When it does it posts 2x!...that silly bubble for messages is annoying and they finally allow you to remove it...privacy is of upmost importance and somehow people I don't know can read my posts etc.  despite the privacy filters...such is the life of being on social media!...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Tried to go to some friends timelines and won't load. Went to other friends comments to read and comment on but couldn't comment cuz comments posted by other people were not available to read. Didn't want to jump into a conversation that I can't read. Please fix this.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Gets the job done, but closes all the time and restarts!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Latest update won't even load half the time and crashes OFTEN. Also dramatically slower than previously. This is a poor version which should have been fixed by now. Just keeps getting WORSE. iPhone 4s	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm frustrated with this app, every since it said to update the gn app I can no longer download it. I keep getting the pop up of unable to download at this time retry or done. Fix please, I didn't have this problem with my S3	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hangs on updating the newsfeed and becomes totally unresponsive. Disappointing experience.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Keeps booting me out! Then I need to log back in & can't! This last update is horrible! Totally slow! New update please!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love Facebook's new update was waiting for "feelings". Only problem I have is that every time I go to write a status the option to add a photo to the status comes up first. I checked that I wasn't pressing the photo button but I wasn't. It's much of a frustration. Also it would be more convenient to have everyone's statuses in order as a default fit news feed because I do not understand how to change it. Because "most recent" only shows what I've missed. Thanks	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
It won't load new updates.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have had a fb for a long time and now it is just a drama fest for kids, ads, and games. It should go back to the way it was about 2 years ago. It is starting to look like myspace :/ ALSO! All the update must have something wrong with them, because the app almost never really works. I can go to one or two different screens then I have to come out, close it out and start over. It's slower than all the rest of my apps and freezes all the time. On a better note: Facebook has been a great way for me to connect with old friends and distant far off family.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I'm happy that Facebook got an update. But it is horrible! It takes forever to load my newsfeed and most recent. Facebook should have a setting how you want to see your news feed. And it is starting to freeze and crash. Once more, I'm not happy with this update!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Last update did nothing for me. There are breaks constantly. Of course I was t on while I was sleeping so why can I only see like six posts from today and them last nights. And I posted a picture, I have an iPhone, and it's tiny. This all needs fixed	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Why does Facebook close without ever opening? It has happened several times where I log on and I'm sent back to my phone. Also, why can't I respond to a comment at the actual comment instead of adding yet another one?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I have to reinstall the app SEVERAL times a day just to get it to refresh...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This app won't not ask me about making a review even when I tell it no thanks I'd never like to write a review. But here's my review o the review of this. Meh.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is great. I use it everyday.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
1- love the inchat smiles revamped2- THE UPDAT BLOWS!!!! It is freezing my app, it is slow and I cannot edit my friends category's from my phone I have to result in removing them.3- I hate that I cannot simply delete my face book account I have to put it on hold.4- this crap goes for the previous up dates, if I wanted my whole life on this stupid site I would go make a billboard to give my number out and personal life story.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
90% of the time this app doesn't work, and when it does it's incredibly slow.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
PLEASE let us turn it SIDEWAYS to type...PLEASE put in a Landscape feature. And STOP freakin CRASHING all the freakin time!!!Even after yesterday's "update" this app crashes more than Stevie Wonder at a Demolition Derby. I DO like the chat bubbles, however.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Crashes more than all my apps combined times 2! Actually crashes more than all the apps I ever had. It's regularly crash on launching it 3 times in a row. Only use it because its the only Facebook app. This app is annoying (times 2)!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sometimes freezes when I tap a picture. At times I have to reboot my phone to unfreeze. Message indicator is screwed up. When the app shows I have three posts, that means I actually have one.At times it closes on its own.All the 'fixes' haven't fixed much. Go back to the original.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Eh...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Overall, I like this app.  There are a couple things that could use some work though.  Loading/crashing issues.  Also, it would be awesome if you'd put in landscape view.  Otherwise, I've enjoyed this app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Not sure why it crashes, probably an iPad glitch. Gets better each update, apart from occasional crash which doesn't impact me at all.Hilariously, it just crashed! Divine intervention?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
So much content that truly want to see and be able to read (really really really really truly, Facebook peeps) is kept from my timeline because of FB's algorithm for feeding content that I feel my world is being censored. Why can't we as individuals decide what we want in our timeline?! Isn't that why you have made that option available to us!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
My phone app works so much better!! Would still love to be able to copy and paste directly from the app on my iphone5 -	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I like the app but it REALLY IRRITATES ME that every time I share something it TAKES ME BACK TO THE FRIGGIN TOP OF THE BEWS FEED!!!!!! Also it constantly switches my news feed from Mist Recent , WHAT I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO RESET BACK TO, to Top Stories.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Crashes or freezes constantly since I updated.bloody annoying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love the Facebook app's frequent updates. It's slowly making its way to having everything you need to use Facebook like on a pc. It just hate how it will randomly close when I'm updating my profile or browsing my news feed. Quite annoying.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Previous versions had no issue but after updating to latest version the badge app icon displays 15+ notifications but when i open the app theres nothing new. I reinstalled, rebooted my phone, even logged out and the badge still displays 15+ notifications. Please address this. Thank you.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love Facebook but it freezes all the time, and kicks me out a lot and they are making changes every week. The things they change are things that they just changed the week before. How about fixing the problems before making anymore new stuff. And it is not my service because I have talked to people with other carriers and they are having the same issues.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

It's a great app and a way better version then the rest except it needs to be debugged allot, like deleting the app and re-installing it.Other then that it's an amazing app	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Not too bad but does crash a lot and won't let me scroll to past posts	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I can't believe how slow this app is once it finally opens after crashing repeatedly. When I do get it open, it give me notifications but there is nothing new on my page. After having to scroll through dozens of sponsored ads and suggested pages in my newsfeed the least they could do is make it run better.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I almost never use it anymore because of the landscape issue. I see google+ in my future	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
1.  It's not loading any Most Recent news.2. It won't load comments from others' posts (or it appears to be trying to load but never does). 3.  It CRASHES. 4.  I'd like the option to keep it on NEWSFEED or MOST RECENT when I open it. I know that there are other issues, but these are the most annoying lately. Please fix.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's very handy and user friendly! I love love Facebook on my phone!! Can they make it a lil better??? Yes!! But all in all, I'm very happy!! :) xoxo	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada

I have never had a problem with this app crashing and every time it updates it is even better. I'm happy with it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Crashes a lot don't like all the extra ads on my page   Would prefer to look at the pages I like instead of every post being put on there.  It's not up to the actual time sometimes post are yesterday and it doesn't catch up.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's keeps closing out.. It's difficult to post and respond to post. I'm really disappointed..	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I enjoy the app an the new features. To me it's the best.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
In the latest update the ability to share a friend's post to a group was removed. The was a feature that was finally added in the last update and now for some reason it has been removed. It was a really useful feature. It is still slow to update and load and closes a lot.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Facebook is the worst. If it wasn't easier to use to connect to people, then I wouldn't use it at all. What's even more annoying is the fact that it keeps asking me to rate it. So here you go Facebook, here's a one star rating because you're the worst. You're welcome!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So the recent update has caused the FB app to crash. Not cool, FB app developers. Not cool.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest update is useless.  App never works properly.  It is perpetually "loading." Please fix!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ughhhh I can't edit events details on the iOS Facebook app. This is frustrating if I needed to do any changes on the go. Plus, the App doesn't allow me to invite new added friends to a previously created events.It Crashes many times over. Doesn't properly enlarge images.

If I'm chatting with someone and I'm in the middle of writing a message sometimes it'll crash for no reason at all. If I tap on a photo it'll crash, if I try to do just about anything it'll crash about 10 times before working. And even when it finally starts working it'll work as slow as possible. I can't stand this app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

- Trying to delete many (not all) of the "Friends You May Know", but I have to delete one at a time. "Help" is no help on this. I want to see a list and select many at one time for deletion. - The app can't turn off friend's Game notifications. Or at least, I can't find it in the "Help "section. I've hidden Candy Crush for each friend, but I get another notice of an achieved level. I don't care!- The app constantly changed my Wall's Sort button from Most Recent to News Feed, which is Facebook's algorithm of what I will want to read(?). - Where's Landscape mode?- inconsistent Birthday notifications. This app is gets frustrating. If the Mobile site would allow the iPhone to zoom in on pictures, I'd leave this app in a hot second.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It works well over all, but I wish there was a way to organize videos from the app. Also it would be really nice to be able to moe pictures from one album to another. Lastly it would be awesome if there was a way to clear catche and data so it didn't take up so much space.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I get to Facebook after it crashes once or twice.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
App doesn't allow me to sort from recent to top stories or vice versa.    Hardly shows any stories (hundreds of friends and I see the same 20 people).  Shuts down.    Shows a squiggly line and clearly misses stories from last visit.   Oh, and now I get a banner pop up EVERY time asking if I want to know the second someone comments.    No. I don't.  I'm looking through someone's vacation pictures.    Leave me alone!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Frequent freezes and crashes. Doesn't remember settings and takes far too long to get to the "Most Recent" view as it very slowly loads all previous posts in the "News Feed" view first. Slow and unresponsive.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
How can such a big company come out wit an application this terrible. Nothing is up to date. App crashes, you have to close it and restart for it to work; sometimes more than once. And I could keep going with problems. Extremely disappointed.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I don't seem to have the problems others do. Maybe it's because I'm on the IPhone.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Update: pressing and holding the keyboard display gives the option to dock or split the keyboard. Docking the keyboard makes it work. The app works fine now. Even my very first issues (deleted) were fixed, so I'm all good. I still appreciate having a Facebook app after not having one for so long. The app is stable for me, but posting and commenting on anything is a pain. The keyboard pops up over the text entry field, so I can't see what I'm typing. The iPhone version works fine. The text field moves up and stays above the keyboard, but it doesn't do that on the iPad.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
You guys need to stop adding these stupid updates like when your in the messaging area you can drag it down that just plain stupid. Also the messages aren't loading fast at all. Way to go you messed that up. Just stop and go back to the original.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I hope copy text will be available on next update	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I'm not sure about all the updates. I hate that when you share something it automatically resets your news feed to top stories. I keep mine on most recent, if they don't fix it soon I'll just use my computer instead of the app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Barely lets you read any feed, then when you try to look at further comments it won't open..... Sucky "upgrade"	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashing still happens quite a bit when messaging friends. It's extremely annoying.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Still lags really bad.Frequent crashes. Stop adding features and fix the bugs!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app is slow (I'm using a 4S so it's not that old) and the newsfeed is missing updates that should be there (compare with what shows up in a browser on a PC).	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's ALWAYS failure to delete pictures or posts. Please fix.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashing seems frequent. Ads have no trouble loading but when I load a status it won't show me the comments it has notified me about. Every so often I even have to go through an extra screen because there doesn't seem to be a way to click that one doesn't want messenger. Also, the persistent lack of landscape orientation support is irritating. Facebook is really sure of its social media monopoly to be giving their users so much crap.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm not sure why some people are having issues with the update/app. It working perfectly fine on the iPhone 4S	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I use this app more than anything else on my phone. I am definitely what you would call a Facebook addict.  If you are reading this review to see if you should download the app, download it! It's a good app, but like all good apps it has it's flaws. It don't load my notification very fast, but it sends it to my phone quickly. But overall it is a good app, just a little slow!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
With the new update fb doesn't kicks me out cx good job better than las time	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It works most of the time, but will get slow and then dump me back to my main desktop on my IPad for no reason. Other times it won't let me type or share a post. The crash and sending me to my home page happens every day now. About 10 or more times. I actually try shutting my iPad off and back on to see if that helps. It's the only app I have issues with on it so I'm thinking FB app needs the help!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Nothing is more frustrating than having to press your home button 5 times just to leave the app. Can't go to my home screen until fb decides it wants to start to update. Opening the app is a challenge in itself! Hit the icon, blank fb screen... App closes on its own... Repeat x3, then fb decides to load. Viewing photos... Don't even think about it! Select a photo to read the details and it either takes its sweet time loading, or the details don't appear for what seems like forever. And the timeline garbage is annoying. I want the old version back; before the timeline. Why is Facebook linked with Instagram?! And who's bright idea was is to get hash tags on fb? It's the dumbest thing you developers have done since fb started. It's annoying to see #hada #funday #atthelake #tanning #withmygirls #drunk #and #dontcare...  Instead of adding hash tags, why couldn't you improve the process of organizing photo albums? Every time I want to move a photo from one album to another, I have to either use my computer or go to the desktop version on my phone. How about editing the friend list? Deleting, changing preferences...A positive to all these recent updates: I can finally delete messages for good rather than only having the option to archive. Though technology and social media are two of the most highly regarded for the majority of the world, can't we keep some of this simple?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Have you guys ever heard of beta testing?  Because it certainly looks like you haven't.  Can't see photos, can't see half my newsfeed, and slow as the second coming of Christ.  If you were my app team, I would fire you guys over this bs you put out.  The version four or five updates ago was great!  Uploads were fast, newsfeed was fast, and you had to go ahead and "Update" an already fine app.  And can you let us have landscape mode for the love of god?  Do not go off those who are giving this app 5 stars, those people are morons.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

UPDATED FOR VERSION 6.2:It still crashes, and it's even slower than before. I have two suggestions for the developers at Facebook:1. Do more thorough regression testing when you add new features. Include some speed benchmarks in the regression testing. And yes, I write software for a living so I know what I'm talking about.2. Forget adding new features. Concentrate on fixing what's wrong first. If the app crashes 2 out of every 3 times I open it, then I don't fscking care about the new features.As it stands now, this app is well on its way to becoming another crippled and useless piece of bloatware.HERE'S THE OLD VERSION 6.1.1 REVIEW:Version 6.1.1, and it seems like all the version 6 releases, are extremely slow to load or to respond to user input. It always starts up in portrait mode and takes several seconds to switch to landscape.Just as bad as the slowness is the fact that it crashes about half the time. Maybe more than half the time. Sometimes it crashes while loading, and sometimes it crashes while in use.The slow performance is NOT related to the WiFi connection or the ISP connection. Rebooting the iPad doesn't help speed it up, either. Previous versions were faster and did not crash as often. Wish I could downgrade or downdate to a previous version.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The newer updated versions of Facebook have been crashing every time I opened the application. Lately I had been ignoring the crashes, but just recently Facebook logged me out of my iPad and iPod. It tells me to log back in on Safari, so I try to login and it requires me to put my mobile phone number for a security check. Problem is:  I know for a fact that I never ever put my mobile phone number anywhere and I definitely didn't give it to Facebook. HOW DO I LOG BACK INTO MY FACEBOOK? It usually let's me skip or ignore the phone number option, but for the security check it says I have to put my phone number in it....but I never did in the past. That makes no sense because it's no longer a security check. They could just send me an email and I could confirm! This might be the last straw. One more majorly upsetting thing that goes wrong with Facebook and I'm done.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Used to be a good app but now takes far too long to both refresh your timeline with other people's updates and upload things to your timeline. Not a network issue a hootsuite works much faster.

If I want to do anything, again, I have to go onto the computer. Fix this.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Absolutely terrible.

The most recent Facebook UI is complete crap. It's hard to use, tacky, and just a mess. Please change back to the old UI, we don't need anything worse than Windows 8.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ok, Yeah it's a blessing . Most of the' time it's great. Thanks once again!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Would've been nicer if there were more "feeling" options or u can add your own	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It use to crash 3 times before I could use it but now I can't even use it for more than 5 seconds without it crashing so basically facebook is worthless! Fix it now	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very good app and easy to use. Very happy with it as long as they don't start messing it about.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Ohhhh FOR THE LOVE OF PETE!!!!!!! Put in a landscape orientation!!!!! IT'S NOT THAT HARD. !!!!Whenever I am messaging someone, right after I sent the message it says that they read it. When they didn't. It trips me up.  And takes forever to log in.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Marked improvements over earlier versions of the app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love it but its so slow loading. Also the new stories button I love that but sometimes it's in an awkward spot and I accidentally push it when I don't mean to :/	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Both the Facebook app and Facebook messenger app stink. They both keep crashing, freezing and it takes forever to show you a picture someone has sent over message. It only shows you half a message. I think that everyone would agree with me that you gotta fix it cuzz it's making us mad. The apps have been pretty bad for awhile now.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Easy to use	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
App has been crashing ever since the update...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It doesn't really work! It kicks you out as soon as you try to get on:/	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It's a great app, it's just that it keeps kicking me out and no, it's not overloaded or anything I check that every time and also it's not the wifi because the wifi works fine, it works on other devices and each time it kicks me out I restart the wifi just to make sure. PLEASE FIX IT!!!Thanks:)	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
New update seems to cause freezing!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Too slow! Cuts out all the time! Sometimes doesn't even open! Pffft get it sorted!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Works fine for me and I haven't had any issues that people seem to be having.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's good - better now you can share but still not as good as the desktop version for user functionality sadly yet.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

The best Facebook yet.  Works great on my iPod touch(:	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Don't see a problem with it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
It works at times, but other times it's really slow and will freeze up.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Perhaps it's time for FB to close. App crashes. Automatically changes privacy settings. Get involved too much in all sorts of games. Too much advertisement that offends me even after I took steps to tell FB it offends me and my believes. Get your act together! New update is toooo slow! Does not update the page at all!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Wish I could tag more than just my friends, like fan pages!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Facebook is basically a utility. Everyone uses it all the time. It's a behemoth. Yet somehow, nobody over there can manage to come up with an app that isn't bug-filled and frustrating. There is no excuse.  Every time there's an update, it's worse.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I have been using the facebook app for some time now and frequently it crashes on me. It's not that I do many things at a time on the app (I mean, you can only really do one thing at a time) and I even go to my own home page whilst messaging so it doesn't constantly refresh the newsfeed. However, it still constantly black-screens and shuts down. I also noticed that for photo uploading from an iphone it is rather easy. You click on the photo icon and click your desired photos. For an ipad it is much more difficult. You click on the icon, go to the folder, click the photo and have to do that every time for every individual photo. I wish they would update the ipad one to be more convenient.Hope this helped.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate the new update, crashes all the time, fix Plz!? Once again it has frozen, Plz fix. Why can't you fix it?? Freezes everyday!!!! Plz,Plz ,Plz, fix!!!!

Ok the update is horrible. Keeps shutting off!! Plz fix June 21rst keeps shutting off, Plz fix	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate the new upgrade :-/ I used to be able to repost things on friends page with my phone , now it does not give me that option , I can't repost on my business page either !!!!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's awesome how much it has changed when I first got mine with just about 20k users to where it is now. Although I hate how people put there life's drama all over it it's still nice to stay in touch with old friends and family and see what everyone is up to.Keep it up	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I installed it before and it was fine, until i decided i didn't need it and deleted it. I recently wanted it back due to the fact that parties were posted on it as well as celebrations etc. but halfway through reinstalling it stops and says cannot download app at given time...??? What?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I enjoy using Facebook & find it easy to use. At times Facebook shuts down & is slow, but it is really nice to stay in contact with friends & family. Lately I've found that Facebook is taking forever to update. It's been worse than ever. I'm still glad to be able to stay in contact with friends and all my family. Face book has been really slow lately.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The updates on the newsfeed has made it more difficult to help friends out on games via posts. Otherwise, it's alright, I guess. :)	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes every time when i'm trying to view photos! Fix this!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
could work better.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Amazing app (: thumbs up!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still no sound from notifications! App is useless if you have to stare at your phone all day to see if someone replies. Please bring back audible notifications!!! 6/21/2012	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
After this recent update, I've become content with using Facebook on my phone. Well done, Facebook, well done.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I think the Facebook app works FANTASTIC I've NEVER had it crash on my iPhone 5 thank you so much for all you guys do to give us the best experience possible	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Never opens without crashing.  gives me notifications whenever people update their status or upload a picture, even if I'm not tagged. Always defaults to top stories, not most recent.  New messaging bubble is annoying.  The new story bubble when scrolling down is intrusive, distracting and completely unnecessary.  Too many suggested posts and game requests.  Convinced me to delete Facebook.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Seriously why are you guys so hellbent on the top stories sorting? It shouldn't be that hard to program it to actually remember that I want most recent. Lazy!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Loading the feed and comments on a specific status became very slow with this latest update!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I use the Facebook app for iPad everyday. I'm grateful for it, and it has evolved. Previously, you couldn't tag photos or posts, and you couldn't share links. Now you can, but you are limited. For instance, you can't share a link on someone else's page. I hate that I am inundated with ads right in my feed that I cannot remove. These are not ads for pages I've liked, but random businesses. Also, this app crashes a fair amount, and sometimes it is so slow it's ridiculous. I belonged to a group, and whenever I tried to read posts on the group page or post to it, it would freeze or crash or take forever just to load the page.  There are still things you can't do in here, so sometimes I have to log in on my desktop computer. There's clearly some improvement still needed.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great app, I use it every day. however, it crashes a lot & has some silly limitations.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Good but not great.  The ever-changing app is not always ever-improving.  But still my go-to for personal social networking.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I just love when I go to and event page and it freezes my phone or iPad! I've loaded the last few "updates" and I use that term loosely! It seems as this the fb app is just getting worse and worse!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's frustrating that you can update profile photo on phone from Facebook photos but cover photo can only be updated from library?!? Would also be good to add comments to photos.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

Well where to start. The app is slow as can be even on wifi as well as the shutdowns or crashes constantly no just once a day but several times and everyday. This is becoming very frustrating	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Nothing is in order. You'll be reading a story from 3 hrs ago then the next will be 5 min old! Then sometimes it won't even show all the updates. And sometimes it will go back to the top of the page without ever hitting to new stories button! Not very happy w the past several versions! They have sucked!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Dear facebook technical team:I did followed (as normally) your updates. This paricular one have BUGS on it.

Write a review...... It's Facebook. Anyone who needs to read reviews to learn about Facebook shouldn't be using social networking sites. In fact they shouldn't be near any device that can get on the net.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

The other 20% of the time it shows activity from several days before. Nothing current. Getting really sick of the FB app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The newest version is awful!!!  It won't update any new posts. It's still showing information from yesterday morning as the newest post. Please correct this update. I'm using the web version now since my app won't work. I've tried deleting and installing it back on my phone multiple times and nothing works. As a business owner who relies on the mobile app to update my business page, this update has done nothing but cause frustration since I can't get it to work.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Every time you update this app, it crashes more and more. Is it too much to ask that I am able to open it the first time?!?! So annoying. FIX IT. I've been dealing with this since your last update.NOW IT WON'T EVEN UPDATE!! It's just sitting on my screen acting like it's updating. Has been that way for at least 3 days. And yes, my phone memory is fine. Can't access FB from the app at all now. WORTHLESS!! If there was a rating for 0 stars I would choose that.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Takes forever to load the newsfeed or when I get a reply and try to check it. They don't show up. Can't really do stuff that you could on the web version (not PC, actually typing in Facebook.com on phone).Overall a decent app. Although they keep making it more and more annoying.

After opening and viewing a link in a post, when you hit the back arrow, it does not take you back to the post. It takes you back to the top of the very first post listed.

The app is not quite as functional as the online browser but that's to be expected. The iPhone app, however, presents a real issue for logging off. To log back on, you just need to tap "Continue" and off you go, there is no option I've been able to locate should you wish to truly log off. Should you by mischance lose your iPhone ANYONE AT ALL can just tap that button and proceed to mess with your contacts, settings, etc. with no problem at all. I do NOT like this setup at all.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Can't stand those "Chat Bubbles", and I'm getting REAL sick of having to select "Most Recent" EVERY single time I use the app!!!Hate it.

Typing status updates, comments, etc. in portrait mode is such a pain. Nearly every app that requires typing lets us turn the iPhone and type in landscape mode with a wider keyboard.

Just when I thought the Facebook app was getting better, I updated to the latest version today and it keeps crashing every few seconds. Also, it keeps showing I have 10 or so new notifications, yet when I open the app, there are only 2 or 3. Please fix, it's unusable as is.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The app works perfectly fine on my iPhone 4. I don't know why it doesn't work for some people. Although I would say that the app is significantly slower than its predecessor, version 6.1. But anyhow, the app works flawlessly on my iPhone 4. A few improvements and bug fixes would get it up to a 5 star application.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
What on earth have you done to my news feed?! I want to see everything, not what you decide to show. Also it's not in time/date order! This makes no sense. Very poor.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

It's a pretty good app really...but every time it updates I'm waiting for one little detail that is on the main site but not the app. That is, the ability to hide a status or other post from specific people. Not by "friend groups" or whatever but by choosing the person from all of your friends and clicking that they cannot see the post. Give us this and I'll be 5 star happy.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

The net version of this app crashes way too much, mostly when I'm viewing messages. Also, please make an improvement where it scrolls down the post for you when you have a new comment on a long post.

The app is no longer useable after this last update. The whole screen now had a red grid over it and i can't see he screen at all. FIX IT!Do you actually read these reviews? None of the problems I've reported have been fixed yet and it's still got bugs I reported over 2 years ago. 1 star review and I doubt I'll raise it after none of the bugs getting fixed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

In my opinion, the app itself is easy to navigate however it is the SLOWEST app ever and crashes frequently. I rarely use it because it's a hassle & takes forever.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

After the new update it loads and works so much faster. No crashing now (so far). I really like the new messaging feature!I still don't like having to select MOST RECENT every time I open Facebook. Anyway to automatically set this would be good. Overall I'm glad for the improvements. Before the most recent update this app was a nightmare.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This is a horrible app. I've had it for a while on my iPad 3, about almost a year and it's always crashing, freezing or just locking up. The only reason I keep it is for convenience but you would think since Facebook is so popular they'd fix it. Get this app only for convenience but it really is a pain in the neck.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Well Facebook has done it again! The sent out an update that screwed things up.

This update appears to have solved the crashing issue on iPhone 4. Loading times need to improve though. It shouldn't take 20-30 seconds to load a few simple lines of text over a fast broadband connection.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Facebook was actually working!!! It wasn't a great app but for the first time in a solid year it worked ok, then the update, it stalled out and "paused" trying to load for 12 hrs, on an iPhone 5 LTE no less, I give up app deleted, what a piece of crap as always I can't wrap my brain around the idea that ppl get paid for this!!!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

I don't see the need of updating, worst than previous update. App crashing is the biggest issue, after the new update the app crash count increase to 10x the amount of crash count from previous update. The new update sometimes does not gives you alert/ notification when someone messaged you, but when it does, it notify you twice which is really annoying.

It crashes several times a day. Not only that it for some reason zooms partway in on pictures and doesn't let you stay zoomed out to see the whole picture, cutting off words of text. It freezes up often and has a lot of lag. I keep hoping that the constant updates available for it will do something, but no changes ever noticeable.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Just one time I'd like to see an update that actually makes this app better. It crashes all the time, very slow, still no landscape mode, you can't keep it at most recent (even though posts should be in chronological order anyway) and most recent since the "update" goes from an hour ago to a post that posted yesterday morning...I could go on, but really what's the point, the developers clearly don't care and ignore users comments anyway. Facebook app=fail	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is ok how ever freezes alot FIX IT!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Apparently in this new version there is bug fixes... This app still crashes loads!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I just updated Facebook and it keep saying I have no connection I tapped the screen to retry but it doesn't do anything. Really disapointed	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Couldn't be happier! Thanks Facebook!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
i cant believe it.s even worst then before.it crashes all the time.pleeeease do something aboutttt it	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
After the last update it won't even load on my iPhone!  PLEASE FIX THIS!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Overall, a well functioning app. However, functioning means adequate, not exceptional. 2 stars lost for things that we currently don't have, this is only off the top of my head so there are probably a few other minor things, but firstly, could you possibly fix the Most Recent option for the newsfeed, as it seems to not work often. Secondly, I would like to politely request that there be an option to disable the chat heads, or if there already is, perhaps to make it more easily accessible. They are slowing all of my devices down unnecessarily, and I never wanted this. They're incredibly aggravating. While I would expect that some people think its cool, and probably use it and love it, I would like the option to not have to deal with them if all they're causing me is angst.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
The update that took place yesterday has caused the app not to work. Mad! Please fix it!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
A very eye opening game.  Beautiful graphics is a very big plus!  The instructions for playing game are easy and very clear.  The only draw back is it bottoms out a lot.  It's a shame because I really love the game.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Make it possible for editing comments (like the online)	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
This app has become a sad parody of the mighty machine it once wasRepeated duplication of newsfeed events leaving me having to delete and reinstall the whole app is fast becoming annoyingNot to mention the randomness of items in news feed and the adverts in newsfeed Sort it out before you fade away Facebook	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I dislike having to log into Facebook.com to use the filter "View Posts By Others"when I am already on the app. Also the ability to look at Archived messages on the App would be great!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Simple, crashes every time it loads. Have deleted/reinstalled several times. Very disappointing. Duplicate and triplicate posts in newsfeed. Cannot view comments or pictures. Some bad updates ion the past, but this is the worst.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Do not like this new update.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Terrible. Picture says it's trying to load and I already have comments on it without it being posted... Posting a status same thing!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The newest update won't load any group pages for me and doesn't really update my newsfeed fully either. If I could give zero stars I would. Guess I need to use Facebook in Safari instead.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I update the app, but still crashes!!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Since the update BEFORE this last update I can not sync my new contacts on Facebook to my phone!!! It basically is telling me they don't exist yet on my contacts in my phone (iPhone 5 contacts...sync section). If its not fixed soon, I'll be deleting the app and not use it! SERIOUSLY COME ON!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Please with your next update make sure I only get 5 seconds of Fb before it freezes or crashes . Or maybe just have the whole thing disappear !!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If you scroll away from a video that has been playing, the audio now continues, but the picture stops, and goes back to the 'play' screen. Really annoying. Either have both audio and video continue, or both stop. Not one continue and one stop!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

I think you guys need to work on updating this app because not many of us Facebook users were able to hear a sound before...but why not now? every time we get notifications when our friends and family likes our posts, photos, comments, etc. you can't even hear a thing except the chat notifications sound. Please fix and update this!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate this app!! So awful it crashes EVERY time I open it! Makes me want to get rid of my Facebook!! I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE. Just use safari instead don't waste your time!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I've just updated and it's completely crashed. Tried logging out and now it won't even open :( Please sort it out!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Generally the app is really good and does everything you want but there are a few problems they need to fix: when you try to edit privacy setting the app crashes, looking at photos zooms in slightly and cuts off the edge of photos. And one of the groups that should come up below 'nearby' has disappeared.  Still shows up on the mobile Internet site but not on the app. But overall I would still download the app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

2 or 3 updates ago this app worked fine. But the past 3 or 4 weeks I'll be lucky if it doesn't crash every 5 minutes. It's horrible and annoying. I was hoping this last update would fix it but it didn't.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I like the app, but version 6.2 awful! The biggest problem with it is 'loading.' Whether it be a picture, comments, locations, etc...I have to shut down the app and reopen it, and often that doesn't even work. Sometimes you're just out of luck.Also, like several others I'm sure, the inability to use landscape mode drives me nuts! It may have passed in the 90's, but most of us have smartphones. One of the advantages to having a smartphone is being able to flip your phone sideways and send messages quickly. This app currently forces painstaking, single finger comments and statuses.Fix those issues and I bet a lot of people will be much happier with the app.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
this app still crashes to much and locks up a lot also!!! you really need to fix this bug in notifications it says I have 32,45,66,93,99 new notifications and I have either 1 or none!!!	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook used to be a dreadful app on my old iPhone 4 but since getting the iPhone 5 it zips along! A night and day difference. I still don't see the point of the chat faces, they're annoying but the app itself is super fast for me now. The newsfeed and comments load with lightning speed.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

I cannot wrap my head around how consistently bad this app is... I mean, how many people have facebook and iPhones?! Of all the apps, this one should be usable, consistent, and reliable... Which it is not. I can't figure it out. I actually really liked the last version. Swiping left for the dashboard is intuitive.	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

When I first got the app a year ago it ran pretty smoothly, and that was on my third gen iPod touch. Every time I download an update the app crashes on the first launch, and I use the fifth gen now. I recommend that a new app must be made from the ground up, because the app seems to become less and less responsive with each update. I'm tired of having to deal with the app crashing when I go to view a picture! A bug when scrolling through timelines needs to be fixed because when I scroll to the top it thinks that I scrolled to update when it is apparent that I didn't and it takes forever to do so! Also when I open up and check every one of my notifications it still says that I have some and it will tell me that I have 10 notifications when I have 2! Still no landscape. Lazy! It was there when I had my third gen! Then you take it out? What the hell are you thinking?	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Why can't you add a hashtag with the mobile app ?? On the safari page it shows where it's highlighted, but only from your own profile page or when you're typing it in..    I like how you can add emoji icons from the mobile app 	1371625200	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Every time I want to view a picture it take an eternity to load and will force you to view it partially and won't let you zoom in or out to see the whole image.

It's a not very functional and limited version of the website. No new app could get away with the problems Facebook has. Perhaps if they didn't make "improvements" every week or so they could actually make it work properly.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Why'd you get rid of it so fast?> Just derping around, trying to post content to my page.> Get an error message and the app crashes.> Mfw.Update: Okay, I am really, really irritated now. I can't share pictures to my page! I have two pages, one big, one small, and I absolutely need to be able to share the small page's content to my big page.Fix it, you incompetent morons.

Sometimes when I post a comment, Facebook will eat it and it never posts. Also, sometimes it will not load comments on a post or photo. It will give me the notification that someone commented, but will refuse to show it. This is especially frustrating on the events page. The whole events section is kind of clunky in general.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Sometimes you'll do an update and its perfect, but then you'll do another that buggers it up and then another where you don't even fix the problem. It takes too long to load newsfeeds. It messes about with most recent, then misses a chunk.. You have to keep pressing most recent/newsfeeds till comes up properly and only after all that will you be able to see your notifications. Please sort this.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

Crash, slow, anything along those lines will definitely sum up this app. Just make it simple, Jesus Christ ..	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
What's good:- i like the additional features, including the cleaner news feed, more options of sharing from the news feed, and the newest feature of adding emoticons or posting activity within your status.- so far, the app has run decently with very few crashes- the new messenger features are nice and fun- i'm not sure what the others are complaining about with the lack of landscape mode; on the iPad, i utilize landscape mode primarily and the app still responds to that, for me.What's bad:- the events part of the app has a lagging glitch, making it impossible to not like and comment on each post in a new window nor to wait an extra five minutes during every two minutes for the page to load/respond. The most recent update did not fix this, and this does need to get fixed -- soon!- COPY AND PASTE needs to be available for when we share statuses with links attached (as well as for posts in general, just in case it's needed) or the statuses need to just be wholly shared -- post, link and all. How bout just make both options available?- despite the additional sharing options in the newsfeed, the options for sharing from a post or photo directly separate from the news feed are still limited. If there are more options from sharing directly within the news feed, all of those same options need to be available in every instance that sharing is available throughout the app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Every time I send a message to someone it crashes and shuts down. It does this multiple times a day and is very annoying!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
It's a really good app would definitely recommend it to people, the only thing that I would change is when it shows when someone is online (to actually show it) and when they were last online as I have to look at my 'Facebook Messenger' to see when someone was last online. I would also change when your looking at a full screen picture (viewed by your phone iPad iPod or whatever) to stop it zooming itself in cutting out the edges of the photo. Other than that its a brill app and would definitely recommend it to people.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

I don't like all the new buttons for the news feed. Acquaintances, most recent, all friends. It's stupid. I click most recent and it gives me feed from the day before or 4 hours ago its all messed up. I like the old one where it was top stories or most recent. Not that difficult. No need the change something that isn't broken. I hate having to go to everyone's page to see what's going on instead of scrolling through the news feed because its all messed up now.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Really irritating that where it used to tell me if someone commented or liked on my posts, now it tells me whenever any if friends does anything.  Which I already know from Newsfeed!  Rubbish.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

The latest update is absolute pile of pants. The main issue for me amongst many is no longer being able to share posts or pics to any of my pages.

What is it with Facebook and mobile apps?! Every update they add more features yet all features are slow, crash or are just not very reliable! Stop adding new features and fix the ones already there, every other social network manages to do it!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Yeah... I like it...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app has become unusable since the last update. Newsfeed will not refresh and notifications will not refresh so I can't see photos, cannot view any profiles either. Crashes at least once whenever I try to open it. Please sort this out!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Facebook updates twice a month at times and every time it gets worse, the latest update has been a joke, Now it no longer crashes randomly, it freezes and takes ages to load,When uploading pictures , you will have to close it after 30, once you try and upload 60 the app crashes and losses all the pictures you where updating.The newsfeed is the worst part of the app, the newsfeed Dosnt have the latest comments or status , it pulls ones from the day before and when you scroll down to update , it just gives the time bar for over 10 minutes.Facebook app needs new creators soon. Or release a new app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Really enjoy the app but would like it more if there was a way to get rid of the sidebar when in landscape mode.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I love Facebook right, but about every 3 minutes when I'm on Facebook it crashes, constantly.  it is getting pretty annoying now, so can you do something about this or give me a suggestion that I can use to stop this? I'm not sure if its just mine but please	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Love to follow loves ones and friends... Great stories here'	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I think the Facebook app is pretty good, there just happen to freezes and such that occurs sometimes.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I don't like the fact the it crashes so much. And now I need to be worry that someone else can get my profile pic and create a new account? It was so fabulous at the beginning, what happened now? :(	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I updated a few days ago and now the app doesn't work. Won't load any new posts or comments, wheel spins and spins. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, same problem. Essentially  I no longer have fb on my phone.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Like the app . Not bad for a phone app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The new app crashes a lot and can be annoying if you are in the middle of writing a status...this happens a lot on my Iphone 4. But it's ok when it has signal which if u are on EE is not a lot of the time. But on the other hand it's good to keep in touch with friends	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Everyone seems to have serious problems with this app, and I can't figure out why. Yes, it takes awhile to load sometimes, but if anything your data network or wifi are to blame for that. If it "crashes" and force-closes, it's probably the phone to blame, not being able to handle the massive amount of data incoming. Chill, y'all. It's Facebook. On your phone. Works just fine for me!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Not the best app setup but not horrible	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can't view posts by others. Puts you in spam for tagging your business from a mobile (not all of us have laptops!). Business posts hardly get seen. Crashes out constantly. Really going downhill fast!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Facebook always kicks me off and never let's me look at my pictures on my profile. I'm very disappointed	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Doesn't give me any problems except for its very slow without wifi and it force closes without wifi but thats to be expected.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

Will u fix this app already been days and can't even access fb. Ever since update hasn't worked!!!!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This update is the worst one yet. It takes for ever to load. When you click on most recent or news feed it shows you things from the day before. I don't even know what was updated it looks the same just a million times slower. Stop updating when there's nothing wrong with the app!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a passtime	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Great app, couldn't live without it. Just a little bit slow.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
it says i have notifications when i really don't have any at all	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Awful! Slow, crashes constantly, photos lag everything up and take too long to load up. Honestly I though better of a big company like Facebook. A horrible app to use.Ignore the 5 stars, they lie‰Û_ this is truly terrible.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I'm not sure if its just me or if anyone else is having this problem as well but the app just constantly crashes randomly. PLEASE FIX ASAP!Cheers	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Got my penis stuck in 20oz soda bottle last week and had to go to the hospital, when I got there they asked how it got stuck in there, I said "I was horny and I didn't think my penis was big enough to get stuck, how else would it get in there?" And that's why I drink Gatorade now.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I don't like that I can't tag business names or certain others without having to go to my pc. Other than that its pretty good.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Keeps you going really, crashes at times tho and a few things need to be sorted.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Expected to be the most used app on my phone but it functions so poorly I recently deleted it from my phone. It takes at least 5 min to update if you can even get it to open. Overall I would suggest not even bothering downloading the app ! Epic fail FB developers	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Can I use a negative star?! Now it won't even open. When it finally does open it freezes up constantly and soooo slow! Listen to the people for Pete sake	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This update was a complete waste of time. Why?  Because none of the "so-called" enhancements work. Just bring back landscape mode and leave the app alone. How do you justify pushing out an update that doesn't work time after time. Shame on you!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This latest selection of updates is nothing short of frustrating! Why will my preferred choice of "most recent" not stay as my preferred option!? As for the adverts, had enough of them too!! Loved the FB app until two updates ago!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Since the update, It crashes two times before starting. Pics won't, or take forever to load.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Is good but needs a few minor errors fixed on it than it would be the best Facebook app update ever!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
copy & paste option would be awesome!!! The ability to copy and paste words, that don't allow you to share would be awesome!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Due to its slow loading and freezing, its horrible.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Only one star until the app is fixed. Why can't I go to a fan page and see what people are writing on their wall anymore?? Very frustrating!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Easy to use and easy to install. Would recommend !	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
When a post is selected to view comments, they don't load.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's an app, that runs Facebook, what more do you need to know?Still need a better way of deleting messages when used with an iPhone, iPod or iPhone (assuming its the same on others). Having to delete them one bit at a time is annoying. Fix that and you get that last star..	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Very user friendly and much less confusing than the full Facebook site. I like chat heads a lot- very easy to navigate between conversations and my newsfeed. Would give 5 stars but the crashes happen much too frequently- at least several times per day. Knocked off 2 stars for constant crashing and slowness of loading.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I like it great way to keep up with friends and family	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Just awful. Takes forever to load anything, even with full reception and full wifi. News feed doesn't ever even update. The developers clearly didn't and still don't care about this app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app crashes on me 24/7. I don't know whether its my phone or not - it does the same for friends so I assume not - but could you please fix these bugs.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Liking the new features. If you can just add the feature where I can type with the phone horizontal off be perfect!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I dont like it that you have to type one way wish u guys made it to where we can type sideways please make the app go sideways	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app stinks. Crashes often, takes forever to load. They can't sell ads like the desktop version so they will never improve it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
No complaints	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I've skipped the "update your information" sections probably 15 times now but it keeps showing up. Why in God's name would anyone be stupid enough to actually list their address, phone number , or any other private information like that if it weren't a business? Please stop asking.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The latest upgrade is very poor, did anyone actually test it before it went out?? It is so slow to update it is painful to the point it is not worth having it. Very poor performance and the I phone 5 notification glitch has still not been fixed!! Seriously thinking of ditching FB altogether	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

USELESS!  This is my third review of Facebook upgrades. With each "improvement" things keep getting worse. I can no longer use FB on my phone as it crashes 3 or more times opening it or using it. I am unable to scroll without being sent back to the start repeatedly and I am seeing 4to 6 copies of each post. I am unable to post any comments at all. It is a totally useless app for iPhone. Very disappointed.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This Facebook works well on my phone . Haven't has any trouble .	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app always crashes. You made an update i updated it but still. FIX IT!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
App always crashes when I open it, and if it doesn't crash, it doesn't update. Also needs new Facebook desktop updates such as picture comments and hashtags.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app is bloody well made, I don't think people are giving FB enough credit for their work.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

Love it after finally got the update to do the feeling , watching etc statues :)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
I can't scroll in the app. All the top buttons (Notification, Message, and Friend Request) work, but nothing below that registers that I am touching the screen. I have tried rebooting my 4s, completely closing and reopening, and even deleting and redownloading the app. Would love a fix, k thx bai.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It does what it needs to do. My least favorite new feature is the little head bubbles that pop onto the screen when you get a message. But I can live with it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
FB for iPhone suffers crashes, just closes without warning, A LOT!  Can't type in landscape mode, which is annoying as heck.  In fact, I couldn't even open this review the first time, it just closed on me and I had to reopen. There are just enough bad things to ruin the good things.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Really unimpressed with the updated app. It still doesn't load all the news stories on the newsfeed plus I find it really annoying that I have to always specify I want the most recent stories rather than the default setting where Facebook decides on which stories take priority. It also seems slower so it's definitely not an improvement on the last version. What's particularly annoying though is the fact that it sometimes shows the updates from the last 20 minutes or so then misses out the next 12 hours to take you back to updates you saw the previous day! Please sort it out... it's REALLY irritating!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Hands down the worst functioning app I have. But I'll keep using it bc how else can I feed my FB addiction? Ugh.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It works just fine for me. I enjoy the convenience of being able to keep in touch & upload pictures right in my hands.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Millions use it daily and you still want me to rate it? And how often? This has been rated by me several times now. It's a ball ache. All the recent changes, constant privacy setting alterations. It used to work fine until you 'fixed' it. It crashes regularly, and tapping on a photo stalls it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Best ever!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Cons:  Push notification still not working.  Ads taking up the whole screen.  Crashes unexpectedly.  Use some of your new stock money to fix this stuff already.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So easy to use! Everything is at your finger tips. Chat bubbles rock!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
i find it to be a great app works perfect on my iphone 5 :)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Just updated and keeps coming up with an error.  Tried reinstalling not working.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hate the update	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
No worky after latest update.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
A huge improvement 	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Thanks for the power of networking!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Ok	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Really dig the new cover photo change!! Been waitin on that forever! The chat bubbles are ok, sometimes annoying. Sometimes it does crash and you'll have to restart it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
there are times when facebook is always behind several hours and is always crashing..wish we could get away from all the advertising too!! could be better	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This version works great!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
this has to be the most ridiculous app, I realise that it has updates and that it has a lot it has to do, all apps have limitations but when I had to update as my old app crashed, this one doesn't give me notifications, thinks that I do have the authority to delete my own posts or thinks that a single letter on a notification on a comment cant be posted as it has been flagged as spam or offensive! what are you all doing?	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Fantastic app !!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
My favorite app.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Why change it so much? It was fine how it was. It's just annoying now.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
You can't copy and paste and thats what's bugging me !!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
It's prone to crashing, but most times it's usable.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great App! Small changes here and there are great! Constantly making the app better!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I think the mobile app is good, but should have ability to copy and paste, etc...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Out of all the apps on my phone this I'd the only one that never works. It crashes every time I open it!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I don't like how this app constantly locks up. Always have to close it out and reopen it. No other app is this bad.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Needed to just update this app on my iPhone 4 and I've tried several times to update with no luck, and even deleted and re-installed the app several times with zero success as it just does nothing now even after turning the phone off and re-starting the phone it seems to just not want to download this app. Very frustrated!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This has got be the best Facebook ever. Plus it's stupid gay	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Fix so that when you look up a friend it starts where you left off and not at the beginning.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love the new feature where the app just doesn't work I think it's just great! 0  outa 10	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nice interface and they release new things very often. Kind of annoying sometimes. Although it crashes from time to time still it's better then the browser one.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This app is awesome font ever delete this app i f**** love it ‰_	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Was working great updated now it randomly shuts down alot.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I hate how you can't approve tags.. And it keeps asking for personal info.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

J'aimerai que sur l'iPhone ont puisse mettre le iPhone de cÌ«tÌ© pour envoyer un message ou sur le tchatte .. Sa bogue beaucoup souvent tout ferme sans aucune raison ...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Great app, easy to use, stable on iPhone. Next best thing to the laptop version.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
One more thing...not impressed with the bubble Message. No longer do I get an icon notification when I have a new message waiting. I'd much rather open messages thru the left side menu or top icon, like it used to be. I do however much appreciate the option to slide your finger over the message now to archive or delete instead of having to go thru safari to do this.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Esta actualisacion lo unico bueno son las burbujas del chat pero toda la aplicacion esta horrible para todo! Todo se tarda en cargar, los mensajes no se envian o no llegan completos o simplemente no llegan! Tarda en cargar me salgo 5 segundo de la app y ya se pone en blanco y tengo que esperar aque carge! PORFAVOR ARREGLEN TODO ESO POR QUE ES UN FASTIDIO TENER QUE ESTAR PASANDO POR TODO ESO! Nose que les paso antes eran chevere facebook! AGANA ALGO! :@@	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Don't like the fact that people that you don't know can see your post when you post on a friend's wall.There should be an option to clear all your wall in a simple step not comment by comment..	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I like the app, but I'm always amazed at what I'm missing on my mobile version compared to the computer version.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I always have to delete the app and re-install it because it won't ever load.Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.I'd give it half of one star if I could.Fix it PLEASE!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This is AWESOME!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
So far the update is pretty neat. I'm digging the use of the thumbs up in the private message, too.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I hate this App. It crashes, stalls out, and jumps around (making you hit things you didn't want to hit) I really hate posting pictures with my iPhone due to the fact that old comments from other pictures are still on there, they don't go away with each new posting! I also don't like how your friends post are not all in order.  You might have several from four hours ago mixed with ones from a minute ago! I hate that!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm very sad with this last update, my feed of notices stay out od my iphone. The last version is more efetive and beautiful.  Please! Change this!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Upgrade works good. No real issues.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
What a great way to stay in touch with family and friends. I like to share pictures and other activities I do. Thank you	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Garbage, it's crashing. Please fix it. Garbage!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I just want the friends lists to be back on the side instead of at the top-- separate from news feed.  I would also be able to use custom share on the iPhone so I can choose multiple friends lists to share with instead of just one.  I hate the iphone app.  Please make it easier to navigate news feed and friends' lists!  My time on FB has decreased significantly. If it isn't improved,  I've even thought about taking many friends out of lists. I do not like how the news feed has to be scrolled down every time and then scrolled back up to change my friends list. My friends lists have been rearranged so I can't find them anymore.  I had everything organized and now it's chaos.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The app can't update. I see the same post for the day I updated it. It crashes as well.... Please fix it.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Nice	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This would be a great app if it didn't crash so much. I'm usually messaging someone when it crashes.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I truly appreciate Facebook! With my children moving out into their own lives, it makes me feel like I'm still connected. With family and friends living in different parts of the country, we still get to share our lives. When the younger generation needs help, they tend to reach put through Facebook, even a lot of adults.  I truly thank God for Facebook!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Enough said !	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's good, but don't enjoy the slowness and when the app closes on itself. Once those bugs are fixed it will be great.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
I love the mobile Facebook! I'm on this several times a day 7 days a week. Although it has crashed on me a couple of times I still gave it 5 stars for a fun, interactive and easy to use app!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The features are nice, but it crashes too much on iPhone!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
this is a good appbut it crashes when I tap on photos, when I try to get out of photos, when I check my inbox, when I refresh, when I close the app and go back in and just about any other time that I do anything with photosso it would be a good app if I could use it without it crashing	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Not bad	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
One word: addicted!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can you update all ,and can you fix the bugs o and you can't change the timeline pic ,on the app ?	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

I love using Facebook on my ipad , its great. The pictures and videos are so beautiful and I can upload my stuff anywhere with my traveling wifi thingy.... Lol. I will be posting many more pictures and videos to share with all my family and friends.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still crashes as and when it wants too, plus groups scroll to the top when something new gets posted which is annoying when your catching up on older posts	1371970800	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
FB is a good app to keep in touch with old school buddies, work buddies, and family and friends, BUT to me it still invades your privacy way too much!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Tired of asking to rate. Facebook has gone down hill. needs new management. Zuckersuck	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
We need the edit button for the fb iPhone app, we need it to be more like the Pc version, compared to the real version and app there is a lot different and it needs to be fixed.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia
Don't bother updating to the latest version. Updating timeline takes and age and has bugs when sorting by most recent. Facebook you should not send this type of release live until fully user tested. Shame on you all as such a huge global operation that currently is not operating as it should.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
It would be nice to add landscape orientation to the iPhone and iPod touch...	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

My way of reaching out to my friends with no effort! Still loved it	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app seems to still be in its infant stage. It glitches. It's slow. You still must go to the pc to make some changes. I made sure it wasn't a router issue. I still use it a lot because its so popular with friends and family. I'm sure things will get better.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Does not work correctly. Can't see pictures and does load correctly. Keeps getting locked up.  Just going to the web for Facebook .  Please fix the bugs!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
If Facebook mobile offered an unfollow post option and fix the bug crashes of late I could see giving it 5 stars.  But since its not an option Facebook gets 3 stars	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Love it but it takes to long to load and sometimes I have to re open it to actually be able to use it.. And it also closes unexpectedly.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
WORST app! With every update it gets worse. Crashes constantly, painfully slow, news stream won't update at all now, pictures don't come into view. I'm totally disgusted.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Fan pages layout is horrible. Can't go thru albums. Why is the timeline on a separate page? And can't view posts by others on the pages. I work with a lot of people in the cosplay industry and like having access to these kinds of things. 1 star til it's fixed. And now I can't share pictures to friends walls.

This last update has not been a good one. Prior to the update my app worked beautifully. Now comments on a post don't load the little wheel just spins and spins. I have a 4s. Did you leave us in the dust? I hope you can fix it. This is not okay.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Get with it facebook, Updates are supposed to be "better" I've had more freezes and crashes now more than EVER!! Continuous crashes every single day.. This is so rediculous...

My newsfeed doesn't show even 1/4 of my friend's updates. It's irritating to have to choose the "most recent" option EVERYTIME I open the app. Awful awful awful.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

The other half of the time it freezes, shuts down, won't update or post comments, statuses, etc. it's a crapshoot. My favorite is when I try to add pictures and it shuts the whole app down and I have to start over. Good times.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
‰Û¢ Crashes way too much. ‰Û¢ I'll be reading updates & FB will refresh with more updates & will automatically scroll very very fast to the top of the updates.

Overall, it's not  bad. The chat feature sometimes goes a bit overboard, as it will notify you in the chat box and still send you push notifications.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Like the new emoticons for status updates	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
The app crashes a lot. Everything, updates to the wall or homepage, trying to scroll, post, seems to take forever to load. Inboxes, you try to scroll the messages and the messages disappear!! You try to scroll a little more and it comes back. It's annoying. Also, I like to inbox things to myself that I don't want to lose. I can't do that from the app. I have to go to my computer. There should be a folder or something like the photo section that can be added so we can "Snag" things we don't want to lose on our walls and not have to inbox ourselves.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I think what could make this app better would be if you were able to change your profile picture/cover photo without having to upload the picture on to an album. With the desktop version, you are able to do so just from your computers storage, so would there be anyway just to take a picture from your library/camera roll and directly put it as your profile picture/cover photo, rather than having a duplicate of it on another album? Thanks :) oh and PLEASE stop making half my messages dissapear. And push notifications don't work.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

Seems to loop all the time since the last update.  Have to exit and re-enter, since the pull-down "update" doesn't usually do the trick.Plus, I keep getting page suggestions from facebook for crap I'd never be interested in or find useful.  What kind of crack-smoking monkeys are working in the  marketing department these days?Updated review:  The mobil facebook application is better than nothing, but only barely.The list of things that can't be done on mobil compared to on a computer is way too long to even start.  Still being bombarded with ads and page suggestions for crap that I'd NEVER be interested.The app seems to get even worse with each "update".If not for my friends on facebook, I'd bail.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This is the worst update I have ever seen, ever since I did the update when scrolling through my news feed, the feed stops and will not go any further, the little circle thinking symbol is displayed and never goes away. The only way to remedy it is to completely close the app out and restart it resulting in your news feed starting all over again thus you never get to see the entire feed as this happens after looking at 10-30 posts. Also when receiving a notification, you click on it and it takes you to the page but no comments are displayed, instead all you see is the stupid thinking circle, this also happens in every group I am a part of. Seeing how I only use my iPhone to access FB if this problem isn't remedied quickly I will be forced to delete my Facebook account all together. Here's son advice Facebook, do not reset the news feed when the app is closed out, give that option to the user........	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook is fine for iPhone, however, it crashes... A lot! Mostly when I'm trying to send an inbox it will crash and I will lose the whole message, it's very annoying. I like the "feeling..."

This most recent update is horrible. There's no such thing as multi-tasking with this app. Exit it and try to go back only causes it to freeze and close itself out. What makes it worse is how slow the app is when it actually works.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook is good to talk to people that you can not see face to face cause of reasons like they live in another country or they aren't with u they are at there house sort of things.

App seems to run fine for what I do, but when sharing a photo or link, why the hell does it have to go all the way back up to the top, switch to 'news feed' from 'most recent' EVERY TIME!???!??!? FIX THIS PLEASE!!And I beg you, please return landscape mode!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I like the app, but in my opinion, there's a few changes that should happen. First off, I don't like the whole 'top stories' business. It should just update to what was most recently posted, not what you think is popular. Another thing is, we should be able to delete posts from this app. I find that I want to delete posts somewhat often, and I believe that I should be able to without going somewhere and borrowing a computer. Also, I have a suggestion. I believe that you should have a choice to see who has seen your profile, and how often they have visited it. Another suggestion is that we should be able to select a certain few people and get notifications when they get online. I believe that Facebook is doing pretty well, but those are my suggestions.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

After using every version since the first release FaceBook still can't get it right. For once, and last, people want "Most Recent" posts listed first. I'm am absolutely sick of having to keep selecting sort by "MOST RECENT" after every post, launch or use. (And don't even think about sticking the option in some obscure settings menu). We want to see in chronological order what is new, not a damned hodgepodge of posts all mixed up for the last week. Good god man!!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

The new update makes me not even want to use Facebook anymore, it shuts down all the time, everytime you share a post it resets your timeline on top of the fact that it doesn't stay on the timeline option I choose. If I pick most recent it should stay there until I change it, that's why I chose it. If I wanted to go back to the top I would click new stories, I did not therefore I want to stay where I was when I shared the post. I don't want the app to dictate what I see I should be dictating the app what I want it to show me.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

my biggest problem is that now the app is being pushed so hard they purposefully make going through the web as painful as possible.. and I happen to prefer the web version. also not as iPad/iPhone friendly as other sites & apps... but everyone else is on it so its a necessity .... it's like those restaurants that have the greatest view in the world so they slack on the food because they know people will always come for the view anyway, why bother making the attraction even better?sincerely, an active member of the zombie nation	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

...with the way in which the app is functioning at present. It crashes frequently; pictures don't load properly, or cause the app to crash; comments that I've received notifications for fail to make an appearance on my photos. These issues are not acceptable, and do not exemplify your abilities as application developers. Either you aren't as skilled as you need to be, or you have become sloppy, and are not thoroughly testing your product before releasing it to the public. Please reconsider your standards as professionals, as this does not reflect well on you.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It crashes multiple times a day and now it is doubling all the posts on my newsfeed and not allowing me to click through a post to "continue reading". Please fix the problems.

#Facebook removed my business page "Instant Assistant Social Media Services"  I had developed and spent intensive time building/developing based on a false claim from a woman claiming all rights to the word "Instant Assistant".  I contacted the woman directly and she was a vicious unbalanced loon that never let me even speak let alone find out why she would troll around FB shutting down people's pages with those words in the title.  I contacted FB several times via requests and complaints to 0 response or assistance from FB.  I want my original content returned to me, yet no response from Facebook.   This woman boasts proudly on her page at "Instant Assistant" that she got FB to shut down four people's business pages in 18 hours!   I contacted FB  again to report this and again no response, no rectification on the people who have been adversely affected by this woman's actions.  She holds NO trademark to the words Instant Assistant!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Links from other apps to Facebook pages do not work?? They did but not anymore since the update. Now all links from other apps to Facebook pages just launch the Facebook app and do not direct to the desired page. Would be sweet to fix this!!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I absolutely love Facebook, it's how I stay on the up and up and keep in touch with my network. If you don't like Facebook well you should probably walk into oncoming traffic	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I don't have any problems with it...it sometimes crashes but if I reload it. It doesn't have problems. So yah great app! :)	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Current News Feed is now 7 days old... even after reboot... useless! Vote 1, #CrapApp! And today at 10am I found nothing for today from my friends. This News Feed issue has been going on for years and the App Techs have ignored this issue totally. I guess it will never be fixed, just waste the project name space! Wife says it's F_CKING USELESS, even on her iPad! My wife doesn't usually swear! App devs, you have reached a very low point! :(	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
Wow. It takes a lot for me to actually take time to write a negative review for an app. On my iPhone 5, the new FB "update" means that it never loads. It just says "Updating..." with the little rotating circle of death until the end of time... no matter whether you restart the phone or not. Every once in a while it will load a couple statuses (stati?). Now I can't use this app when I need to for a nonprofit cooperative I help manage. All my other apps are screaming fast.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It crashes AND it lags when you want to see a photo or open a link. It is better then any other app for facebook, or safari, though. I still love it!!!<3	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

I think this app is very good. I almost enjoy better than actually getting on Facebook From computer. The only thing I would suggest that they improve is that we should be able to set customized privacy from the app as well like you can do from the computer. Example: everyone can see post except Mr. John Doe, Jane Doe, The Cosby'sNo one can see post  except Jane Doe, John Doe, The Corby's. Would love be able to do that without having to log into my account online from my computer or thought the browser on my phone. Hope they actually make that change one day other than that its a pretty good app. I'm just saying......	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook has become intensely slow, battery draining, and crashes every single time you re-open the app.  Not to mention the fact that you have to reset your News Feed every time you come back on the app.  In all, you're better off using Safari for your Facebook.  The app has just became a major disappointment, and a waste of my time.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very frustrating. Have to relaid several times when I want to play videos. Please fix!!	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

This latest version is much improved, and does run so much smoother than before. I've downgraded my review by one star however due to their inability or deliberate ignoring of the issue getting it to show the posts in order of most recent. I do not want Facebook deciding which posts are important to me, I just want to see them in order. Regardless of how many times I change it it then reverts to some strange order and this is becoming very irritating.	1371884400	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK

This latest facebook update is awful. I keep having up delete the app and add it again. It works great for shout a day and then it bugs up again- I see the same post multiple times in a row; cannot view comments, pictures, or see the whole post/status update; and it automatically will send me to the top of my newsfeed when I am scanning through all of them. I don't know what happened, it used to work great!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Otherwise a decent enough app..	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Please and thanks!! Ill five star then!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
First big problem is that Facebook doesn't seem to interface with the iPad very well, often freezing up, slow or failing to load pages, losing postings and shuffling items mercilessly.Facebook itself could be vastly improved if "it" only listened to its users, even just a little...minor things like finding, sorting, saving various types of postings, adding further options for input, some that may be more critical than just being able to "lLIKE" or comment......it is vastly popular despite its many shortcomings, largely because it was first and so most utilized...but unless they respond to users ongoing and often vociferous complaints, a competitor will arise than will make them history.UPDATE: PROBLEMS WITH IPAD HAVE CONTINUED TO ESCALATE TO WHERE IM ABOUT TO JUST GIVE UP !!!....I much prefer using iPad for size, and format of pages, but when it don't work, it just don't work ! 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I've read bad reviews and generally thought "if the complainer just had a little patience with the app it works fine". Not this time. I was prompted to update my app Tuesday 6/18/2013. Since I have updated the app I have not been able to use the app. By this I mean it won't update my newsfeed unless I turn my brand new iPhone 5 off and turn it back on again. And when it does work after turning my phone off, I have a window of about 2 minutes before the app won't update again. I know the site itself is working as I receive email notifications just fine. I simply can't view them on Facebook because your last update screwed up the app. Please fix ASAP.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everything LOOKS good. I like the option to select moods and stuff but there are comments i cant see nomatter how many times i refresh. I have to goto my browser just to see comments ppl have put up on my thread sometimes. Old version was better. I can live without mood settings	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app always crashes, and it keeps freezing. It also keeps logging me out, so i have to log back in like 10,000 times in order to post something or to look at a page. I very much dislike the updates because in my opinion all that has happened is you've made the app even harder to operate. So therefore, instead of always checking my newsfeed and chatting with my friends on the Facebook app itself, i use the Facebook Messenger app, which actually functions for sending messages.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Comments are unreadable. Pictures take forever to load. Have to close and reopen app, restart my phone then close and reopen app again for it to update.

When u delete something off your timeline it crashes and the app turns off and goes onto the home screen. It is very slow. And you cannot add more than 1 photo/video at a time	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
When I saw that there was an update, I thought "finally! The constant crashing will stop". But, I was wrong. STOP ADDING STUFF UNTIL YOU FIX THE AP CRASHING EVERY FIVE MINUTES. Please and thank you.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This app crashes too much!! I'm posting something or I'm looking at other post and my screen clears going back to my home screen!! If it weren't for the crashes, this app would be super awesome!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Where are the b-day reminders? Sharing posts is a pain. Please, app developers, just imitate what you have on the website.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Well the "Bug fixes" apparently weren't for what everyone is complaining about... The app still crashes EVERY time I try to use it. The current version crashes every time I open it. I had issues with other bugs in the past, but this is ridiculous! I can barely read the first two or three stories in my newsfeed before it crashes on me. Instead of adding new features, how about fix the old problems!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
On my 3GS the app crashes almost daily and sometimes for specific functions like commenting on a post will send it crashing. I have uninstalled and then re in stalled it with great hopes but still same results. I like FB but don't like the mobil app version	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Update for option when post can copy it again to post with other page,about the cover photo can add too with next version.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

When it works its great. But it gets extremely unstable at times. I have to close all applications and then it works okay. Also I don't get all my postings on my mobile. I notice more on my laptop that are not on my mobile.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I love the app! The little bubble thingy that pops up when a friend has messages me rocks! It makes it so much easier to check messages.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
More convenient than using Safari but the mobile web version is better. There are no birthday notifications. Viewing pictures make the app crash. Every time the app is tweaked it slows it down and makes it more unstable. The early versions were way better. Keep it simple!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's aight	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Bit buggy. Slow on refreshing comments for posts even when connected to local wifi.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I just recently updated this app & now every time I log on, the app is frozen up. I need to completely shut down the app and log in brand new. In addition, pictures no longer want to load and pages are not loading! Completely frustrating! Please help fix this once, amazing app!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's an alright app. The only thing is if you go out of it to text someone or because of another app and try to go back into this app, it doesn't fluke it and decided to freeze and send you back to the main screen of your phone,	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
A pointless "update" which only added features that aren't that useful which made it even SLOWER. I downloaded the new "update" in hoped that it would run faster, but nope... same old same old. Ridiculous Facebook..	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It keeps telling me in the alert icon on my home screen I have 10+ notifications, I don't. It takes about 10 or more seconds to view a picture and I can't click for comments.. When I click a picture it shows for a second then goes black.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's a great app- there are only a few things that I use Safari for Facebook, such as changing the caption on a picture and to use FB as a displayed on normal webpage. Few things that would make it easier= When I upload pictures through the photos "share", it would be great to be able to tag friends then before posting. It would be great to edit photo albums and pictures through the app. It would be great to do a short display of birthdays etc for the day when you bring the app up, like how safari displays it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Slow as possible and crashes all the time. You'd think, with all the money they make, they could afford to make a great app not this piece of crap...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Now I would really like to have given Facebook more stars but as a platform on iPad 2 it is probably the most annoying I use.. It's bug ridden to hell, I have had my iPad checked out twice with apple and they say there Is nothing wrong with it at all... Instead of bringing out minor adjustments to the format, I would suggest that if Facebook really want there large money maker to continue its success, it would be better to fix the problems Facebook has on certain systems... Works fine on my laptop, but iPad is slow, locks up, unresponsive... Please don't say "it's another app causing the problem".. Well I have had nothing installed apart from Facebook just to prove that and it's no different... Oh we'll 2 out of 5 for me...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

The last two updates have been terrible. I don't understand why it's such an unstable platform on iOS, it just keeps crashing. I have no problems with other social media apps, so I'm abandoning facebook's official app, and downloading Hootsuite.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Open close reopen close reopen close give up.  This is what's been happening  since the last update.  Every time you try to look at a picture or comments the app closes.  Really?  You didn't test the update before releasing?  I am really frustrated with the app and now I actually have to use my laptop to go on Facebook.  Fix it!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Fantastic app but still not 5 stars because sometimes all peoples statuses appear jumbled up, you get something that was wrote 5hrs ago at the top and things 2mins ago further down, if this could be sorted out then i would give a 5starI still prefer to use the app rather than the desktop site, alot less cluttered	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

My only complaint is the loss of landscape position.Okay, FB just had to harass me for another rating.It lost a star.Crash! Crash! Crash! Lost another starNow crashes even more since updates.Well, the jackasses insisted on a rating AGAIN. Good timing, the app has gone from bad to worse.

So I can message my friendsMake plans, or just shoot the bull. If you have Facebook on your pc, then why not your iPod or phone or tablet?

Although this version is much better than previous ones (still many improvements are necessary: when tagging distinguishing between. Being with someone and merely naming them is necessary, for example) I don't get why it crashes so often. And now, I have a permanent red number 1 badge notification despite the fact I have no notifications. Reinstalling the app didn't help. What the what!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It doesn't work (I have a 4S).  The app opens to a blank FB screen, hangs then closes. Reinstalling doesn't help either. Reading other reviews it looks like I am not the only person with this problem. Avoid this version and wait for the next update when this will hopefully be fixed, in the meantime it looks like I'll have to fire up the old PC if I want to check FB...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I can't do ANYTHING without it crashing,lagging, or just freezing. Every time I try to load a picture, it crashes and goes to the homescreen. The message bubble things are retarded. Everything that you add on to this crappy app, lags all of us even more. I don't even wanna rate this app one star because of how slow it is. You minus well just take the app off the AppStore because no one likes it. It's pointless .	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

If you want an app for hours of endless frustration, this is the one to have.

After installing the lasted update, I rebooted my ipad just like I do after I install or update every app.  After the reboot.... The Facebook app icon disappeared.  I cannot uninstall it because there is nothing to uninstall. I cannot download the app again because it says its installed already. I'm at a loss on this.  I now have to use safari to open Facebook online. I have the very latest ipad, it's 6 months old. It's not the ipad.. It's the app. Please fix this issue.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

There are still several important features - like highlighting posts of significance the the APP cannot do. The tasks the APP is doing are all functional and OK.Dev. Team: why not just make the APP do what desktop can do? If Fbook doesn't become as good on mobile as on the www employers will close out access to staff; critically decreasing effectiveness of the social platform.

Ever since I upgraded the app all it does Is crash, barely ever loads, and when it does it takes forever to load anything like pictures or videos! It's a bunch of crap and should be fixed. I've talked to a lot of my friend and they agree that they're having the same problems!Total JUNK!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Although I like the new additions the app has to offer, I would say the update really was disappointing! What's the use of the cool features if you don't get to use the app? It literally crashes atleast twice everytime I try to use. The messaging has become really slow and it freezes for a while everytime when someone messages me I try to reply to someone. If someone is still using the previous update, please do not update to this version! I hope a new faster update comes in soon!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Have an iphone 4s? dont upgrade this the new version. Bad Upgrade! c'mon developers!Sure, the GUI is nice.... But the actual function is as slow as snot... Errors on logging in, and is barely functioning on my iPhone 4S!!  It's pretty much useless...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pretty good just need to work our kinks of App freezing and screen issues!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
ok	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The new update has rendered this pretty useless. It constantly stalls or crashes. About as useful as a tramp's collar.  Don't bother.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
THE APP KEEPS FORCE CLOSING I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT AND ITS REALLY ANNOYING	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This has to be the worst client Facebook could have possibly released for the iPhone. Nothing shows up.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the book a lot but I hate it when it changed cuz it makes you update and changes what you just learn; how to share photos how to tag, it shut downs on its own way to much you get penalized when trying to get on celeb pages when they tell you to add them, comments disappear I written to complain but nothing, I think people be controlling my page. I don't think we should get punish for trying to connect to celebs pages.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Crashes and is really slow	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Since downloading the latest version, the Facebook app keeps quitting.It would also be really nice if we could have message notifications for all pages.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Are you even listening to us? I updated the app and it STILL CRASHES. Fix this! It's ridiculous. I'm about to stop using the app and just use Safari. FIX THIS.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The recent update you did is awful. The app takes forever to update or it will not even update. Please fix ASAP. Thanks!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
In find friends mode the abbreviated alphabet is no longer on the side to skip ahead to who I'm looking for; the info of when someone is logged in isn't always true--if u want to chat with/send personal message to someone u have to refresh the screen several times before the actual data will update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
App crashes, pictures take forever to load, and when they finally do, it only loads up half the picture. Stop updating fb. You arent helping anyone. Just irritating the worlds population.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's OK. It can definitely be improved though.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

It's crashed on the I phone 5	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
it's awesome...when it doesn't crash.or when it doesn't erase my comments right after I post them.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
The app as a app works fine. What I think about what Facebook does with it or what they add or don't add is another story. My review is only as asked to rate the app. And that review is it a good app and works fine.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's ok I guess.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Im enjoying the current version with ease and stress less! Congratz FB‰_	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It works better now on my iPhone 4 & love how emotions were added to the app!! The only problem is that is keeps closing itself here and there but not as much as it did before.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Since I updated my facebook it's been all crazy and super slow.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest version now has stupid chat bubbles that cover up parts of the interface. No obvious way to disable this poor design change.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's great I love using this app I am confident it will continue to get better and better! Keep up the good work and thank you for your service!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Unfortunately it's the only decent way to use facebook on a phone/ipad, I hate when I share now on a picture it jumps all over the place, hate that I can't tell if I'm looking at most recent or newsfeed or what, and I especially hate that facebook openly censors and/or manipulates pages that they disagree with politically, I miss the old facebook, back when myspace was still alive, it's too much of a monster now.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the app, but have some issues with it. Some days I open the app and it immediately bumps me out.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Works really well!!! Works better than before  :)	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Could FB be better? Of course! Is it outstanding? In my humble opinion, unquestionably! I use FB daily, sometimes hourly, and it has enriched my life immensely.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Love staying connected.  Hate all the changes FB makes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

No one likes the landscape mode. No one likes the other useless crap that slows down the software. Fix the stability first then work your way up. The app crashes WAY too much. I can't see an image in a message without the app crashing first. The website is getting useless changes and the pages feature on the app and website is horrible.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
You guys gotta fixing this app... Is a disaster	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Usually when I'm going through a friend's pics, the app will black screen on me. Lags a lot too.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

No words can say how much I love Facebook. Jk there is one word drama -.- 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I like the convenience of this app, and most of the interface, but it remains slow and crashes a lot. Almost every time I click a picture, it freezes, and it crashes often just opening pictures and links. Also, if I try to play a video, it takes minutes to load and freezes during playback. If I open it safari, it plays fine. Every time there's an update, I get excited thinking maybe they fixed the crashing problem, but it still crashes.....	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Disgusted that this company has so many ties with politicians ($ backing etc...) that have NO respect for our privacy.  In case you forgot NOTHING on the web is sacred.  ESP not on FB, think about it.  All that knowledge of all of us, huge amount of power in that :'-(.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

This new update won't let me upload pictures, and it won't send pictures from Instagram onto to timeline. Very disappointed! Please fix!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So when I'm scrolling through my newsfeed, and find a post on a friends/liked page I want to read I open it and 2 seconds later Facebook crashes. Then I reopen Facebook set the news feed back to "Most Recent" but it seems that most if not all of the posts I just read have disappeared. If this is facebooks way of saying "sorry for the crashes. Here please start where you left off", its not good enough. Just stop the crashes entirely...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Phone app for facebook is not really good. Apart from uploaded photos easier from phone to facebook... I can't think what else is better on. If u accidentally post something on your phone Facebook just can't delete it unless u use your pc Facebook.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Ipad use typically crashes when I try to follow a link or watch a video... To avoid this I forward into safari.  When i return FB takes me to the most recent news feed post so I lose the post I was interested in and must work all the way down the feeds to find it.  Should have an option to stay where you last read and to scroll up to newest.  Don't like the online and chat bar on the page either. Should have an option to turn that off.  And lastly I don't like all the political censoring by FB.  Shows obvious bias.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's has crashed more than I care to say. They have some more bugs to work out.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Why can't I edit posts? Having to delete a post and re-write it just to correct a spelling mistake seems to be a pretty big flaw.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada
Privacy IssuesWhen I approve a Friend request PLEASE DO NOT Post it on the Feed for Everyone to see. I Do NOT want everyone to know who I have approved. If they want to dig through y friends list to see that's one thing. But PLEASE do not notify my friends that I've "become" friends with someone. I feel violated. Please make a Setting to stop this or just stop it all together. No one needs to know when people add people as friends **update this please**Not to mention. I'm constantly kicked out still.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Pathetic. I can't even get the app to open at all and I've deleted and re-installed it many times and still nothing.! Optimise the app for iPhone 4S and other devices, not just iPhone 5!! It was all working fine until the new updates.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Glitchy. Doesn't always update comments. Sometimes they erase your posts if political. Timeline gives easy access to your info. Scetchy. Also if you meet a new friend in "real" life and try and "friend" them, without any mutual friends, Facebook punishes you by suspending your friend request feature for 30 days. Lame. Also if you have political or spiritual principles that don't align with fascistbooks views, your account gets edited by the admins. If you friend new and interesting people you don't know, they'll suspend you from friend request for being overly social on their social network.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook is so easy to use through the app for an iPhone or other apple devices. I like how you can organize your friends into groups and set certain settings for individual people. Facebook  just keeps getting better.- the only thing I do not like is the new message thing where you have to drag the persons little circle to the bottom of the page that's annoying an unnecessary !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook has brought me back to my old friends and lost loves and to keep us all connected. I check it everyday when I wake up and every night before I sleep. I don't think children under a certain age should has access to it though. There are some sick people preying on young men and woman. They should be blocked if they have a sex offender record.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

I like this new update! It's easier to talk to your friends, given that the app allows you to speak almost anywhere on Facebook. I signed up for the new newsfeed in March but I'm still waiting for it to appear on my computer. The newsfeed on this new Facebook update looks very clear and and it's easier to navigate around Facebook! The new "Chat heads" chat messaging system is easy to use and is one of the aspects of Facebook, I really enjoy. A fantastic app overall!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

Crashes a lot!  Every time I try to post a pic it crashes. I don't like that it won't go into landscape when I turn my phone. Would make it easier to post comments, etc.  I HATE that it constantly goes back to "news feed" when I pick "most recent".	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
With the latest update I now need to tell it to show me all recent posts every time I open the app.  Even then it's not showing me all of my friends' posts.Facebook, please stop trying to tell which of my friends' posts you think are most important.  I will decide that for myself.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is a joke, the newest version on iPhone 5 constantly crashes, it shows you have new messages but won't even load them up, closes when you try to open it & freezes when you try to view pics. If you can deal using browser based Facebook id strongly recommend it, this is a headache you DON'T need!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
latest version worse than the prior...funny how i can do a search in the net one day then there are ads for that search on facebook the next & i had my privacy set so my profile doesn't come up on a google search & now it does...Posts from friends are buried under ads, suggested pages, & app ads...need a similar app to facebook purity that's out for windows pc's...freezes frequently...now the little bubble of a picture of the person who sent a msg?  gotta drag & drop to an X at the bottom of the page to get rid of it...all the updates in the past few months i'd hope the app would get better, not worse...but worse is what it got!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

My review is this, when I am on Facebook I really enjoying talking toMy friends & Family! It's just a clickTo get my service. Fast source ofCommunication! It's Great!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This is a great app connecting but they should make it that u can edit picture such as crop them and rotate it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
This update has a big improvement, since I used to have to start it several times before it loaded up without crashing. Would be better if it didn't try to give me a tutorial on the new chat heads that were in the previous update. But great over all.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Can't share in my page	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Hands down the worst app on my 2 year old iPhone 4. Each update gets worse, crashes, freezes, slower than a 1 legged tortoise and can't even show "most recent" when I select it, let alone remember my choice when returning. Appalling considering the pedigree. Sack your dev team and start again.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Likes and Comments work for a while then they don't for a longer time. Frustrating when you are trying to communicate with family and friends!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I'm sick of all these ads popping up in my newsfeed. Some of them are wildly inappropriate, like fireworks events while our city is on fire, or batman the morning after the aurora shooting. It's obnoxious really	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
New update is horrible, just loads and loads.....can't use at all	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I like the update, but it keeps booting me out of Facebook on my iPod -.- and it's very aggravating .	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I hate how i'll like something and then it will automatically update my news feeds and move me to the beginning of them instead of leaving me were I'm at.  Even sometimes it will update and it will move and skip a story or too!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time you guys "fix" or "improve" Facebook you just screw it up!!. This latest version j's by far the worst... You can't see the posts from friends it won't allow me to post anything... You are causing a lot of people to stop using Facebook	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The app always crashes and I can't view photos properly either. The photo loads part way then stops or ill try to zoom out to view the entire photo and it snaps back.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Too many f***ing advertisements.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
A very nice way to be in touch with family and friends as well as make new friends. Also a tool to share your faith.'	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Been acting weird. Not opening items correct. Shutting down for no reason. Don't like the new info bar; can't click on options until it goes away	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Slow to respond and load. Gets good then bad quickly	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
No panorama is VERY frustrating. A lot of freezing up then automatically exiting the app... I do like the new option of sharing posts with specific friends, though.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hello, I updated my Facebook and now it takes FOREVER to update..	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
it's slow - it's always been slow - and this new update crashes all the time. how hard is it get it tested properly before hand prior to releasing it ?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
After all the recent updates, it has gotten much slower to load messages and crashes regularly.  This app turning into garbage.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Under the most current update at least, FB crashes completely randomly all the time. It's very annoying. If that one problem was fixed I'd give it 5 stars.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great app!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Got no problem with it just when I open it up and refresh, I get to see my status sometimes...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Notifications no longer updating on app, and my newsfeed isnt updating either.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This latest update is the worst! Click on most recent and get nothing more recent than yesterday.. Pictures don't show, crashes. About ready to unload this app. Sad because I use it all the time...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Shuts down out of no where.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Keeping in touch with family and friends & sharing your special moments with them is great!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I wouldn't be without it All the animals we help on here is great	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I think Facebook needs to quit putting blocks on peoples account and quit discriminating against people with Disabilities and people who are conservative and people who are tea party people also please remember Facebook and Mark Zuckerburg are in the tank for Obama if you are a conservative and a tea party person I would highly suggest you go to tea party community and not facebook and facebook still has not taken the 30 day block off my account and needs to ASAP and facebook has allowed porn and allowed a chef to put a page up to promote the killings of cats and dogs by cooking them very sick and has allowed the sex trafficking of young kids and prostituting and bullying on there websites	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Every time I go to view photos the stupid app freezes.....	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Book	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The app still shuts down on its own.i hate that it updates automatically when someone posts something new and it scrolls me back to the top. It gets very annoying when I'm reading a post or scrolling through and suddenly have to start from the top again. I also want to be able to unfollow and hide people from my newsfeed using the app instead of having to wait until I can get to a computer.I also hate the photo synching!!! I don't want ALL the pictures I take on my Facebook. If I did I'd post them myself	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Facebooks been frozen for 8hrs, superwoman slow before update and now isn't working!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Just need to go back to original newsfeed, don't need all that extra, I doubt anyone uses it!!! Other than that the most recent updates are awesome	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Every time I get on I have to click on most recent posts ... Which I do not like .... Then when I try to share a post it either closes the app or I have to click on most recent again.... VERY ANNOYING!!!!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Please fix this version, it is completely unusable!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Thought bugs were fixed?!? I have more critters now than ever. WTH, Facebook? Why ya gotta keep jacking with it? Might ought a check out the 'bugs' that are trying to fix the bugs! Just my opinion.. We're all getting a bit fed up with all this bs!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The latest update, the notifications on my home screen are not matching up with the notifications in the app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Facebook won't work on my mobile device (iPod5) since updating to 6.2. No problem on laptop or PC. I have logged off/on a few times, and deleted/reinstalled the app a few times...still not working. Won't allow me to comment or share pics...just continuously shows "updating" but never actually updates. Frustrating.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The new update messed the whole app up.  Can't click pictures or comments..... Please fix it stinks!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The "most recent" setting only shows me stuff from yesterday. That stuff is not recent.Also, even when I "hide" posts, they show up as soon as I refresh.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
From bad to worst..it was my review of the last two updates. But this new one beats them all. One word: crash	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Dope	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I love this app <3	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It's freezes and restarts a lot. I like the new FB mobile!  It reminds me of what I liked about MySpace back in the day!  Kudos!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I luv that the moods was added now I don't need 2 jump from my tablet 2 my IPhone 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It closes and I have to open the app again like 3 times . Please so something	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
This app WAS good..... Now won't even load. Just a blank screen on timeline, no news is bad news. Can only think this has something to do with the latest update as it was running perfectly until I updated the app.As the title says - SORT IT OUT!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Awsome	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
For the most part, I find it difficult to use. If you want to share something the screen, it jumps around and doesn't take you back to where you were. There is no privacy and Facebook colludes with the government to spy on American citizens. I am just glad I didn't fall for the hype and limit my use.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Lately, when I share a link it can be sent once or copied up to 4 times!  What's up with that?  Sometimes changing settings doesn't work.  And I don't want pages recommended to me.  I'm now having to pay to get more followers to see my ranch page.  This is a teeny-tiny ranch and the costs per view are too high.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I'm just addicted to Facebook,and I have also found friends that I have not heard from in years..!excellent.!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK

I use mobile FB all day long however there are many bugs. Crashes too often, especially when adding a pic to 'chk in'. It wud be nice if there was a way to unfollow a post.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Update made this worse..	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Why does it always crash?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I joined Facebook way back in 08 it was much better then you had privacy! Now it run everything you do!!! So only 2 stars!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This company makes me sick.  I hate Facebook and their liberal edits of posted and content.  Looking forward to canceling.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Ha mejorado bastante, pero sin duda podrÌÁn mejorarla mas, sobre todo en la versiÌ_n que tienen para iPad que en su primera presentaciÌ_n empobrece la aplicaciÌ_n.Pero hablemos quienes tenemos el primer iPad y nos gustarÌ_a la aplicaciÌ_n fuera aun mejor.Gracias!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The last couple of days this app has been insanely slow, all my other apps work completely fine except Facebook, nothings loading and my wifi works fine, this is really annoying	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
For the most part it's great. It's crashed on me a couple times. But not every time I use it	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It crashes sometimes/ freezes	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's always crashing. Won't access any photo folders, only the camera roll. Slow. Fix it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I find that the loading process is slow. The app even kicks me off of it sometimes. All of my updates are current too.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I would like to be able to edit a comment with out having to completely remove what I was writing from my phone. I like the recent addition of share.  I like this update.Still closes unexpectly~	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I've never had any problems with this app and its convenient! Great app!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
FACEBOOK JUST BUG EVERYTING !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Iphone 4- When I open app it takes forever to load content. And then I can't even get notifications unless I open app. Inbox message notifications don't show unless I open it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It does what it needs to do. But. It's very slow, very flaky and constantly changing and more often than not, not for the better. Annoying there is no landscape version. Odd that status updates by friends shared with my gf don't appear on mine but do on hers. And so the list could go on... Oh and NOW the notification overlay that blocks the notification list and then if you don't click it loses the unread status of the notification! Shoddy.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
To be honest,it is rubbish. I downloaded it and it took 5 minutes to load the first time. Suddenly an error appeared and said I had to uninstall an app to keep facebook running clear. So I did what it said and deleted facebook after always waiting minutes for it to load-_-	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Runs way too slow. Takes forever for content to load. Facebook doesn't seem to care to fix it. No wonder the stock is tanking.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is good but you should be able to play Facebook games	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
I give it a 3 because it shut down on me  unexpected !!!! And when I want to delete a post on my phone it won't let me do it and I will have to go to a PC to deleted on the Desktop Version	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Why when I go to write a status it automatically brings my pictures up?!  Who wants that?  Ridiculous.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's crashing too many times and sometimes it won't work and i have to shutdown	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The only thing that Bugs the crap out of me is that the wall is bloody random, I like just recent stuff and it keeps sticking stuff in from last night!!!

I like the new feeds, but its been occasionally crashing on my iPhone 4 lately. Hoping the new update fixes all the bugs! The more things they add, the more things go wrong!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Mine doesn't crash at all :/  great app ......	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Facebook USED to be the bomb.com, however ever since twitter came out, it has definitely spiraled out of control. You all should have kept Facebook the way it was before all that timeline mess you added. Now it's all confusing. What's the point of a timeline for FACEBOOK? You should've remained with the ORIGINAL ideas of Facebook, not this new bs!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I wish I'd never updated my old app, it worked perfectly!  This update tells me I have 32 hits and I'll only have like 3, which is just a minor thing. The real irritation is uploading pix from my photo roll. I'll chose a pix and when I press upload it will upload another pix or sometimes it will have already chosen 5 other pix that I didn't even see. Very aggravating!  Never had this problem with the last update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Okay I love the app But it would be better if you add a video chat feature please I really need it I know that Facebook on a computer has the video chat thing but I need to have it on my iPod/phone	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love the Facebook app, it's easy to use but you need to update again, I'm getting so annoy how it keeps crashing on me when I'm trying to send a friend a message! Or even just loading it, it will crash moments later... Please fix what ever is causing this!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Facebook needs to stop changing.  Other then that it's ok for now. And every time I click out of Facebook I have to resign into Facebook iv never had to do that.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Good app when it works properly	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
I am glad they updated the Facebook app., now it has a share button. The only thing I don't really like is the chat bubbles they are kind of annoying. I do like that you can change your profile pic from the app now, the next thing that should be added is the ability to change your cover photo from the app as well.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Love it	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Still... Your adding more sh*t before you fix what's broken. Your going from bad to worse. Don't you read your reviews? I see more and more people joining google+ Looks like face books going to be the next myspace. Obsolete!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook won't load since the new up date. It just sits there with that annoying star-loading symbol. Please fix! It's been "updating" my news feed for 6 hours now.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Whenever I open any picture on my timeline, it either crashes the app or takes multiple minutes to load and grant touch screen capabilities again. It's frustrating.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
I tried to update the app but now the update won't even load. All my other updates worked just fine, but I have been waiting for the facebook app to update for almost 30 minutes. It hasn't even started the update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook on iPhone is just bad. There are several important and common features I use that I just can't control from the iPhone, and worse, insane "chat heads" pop up constantly. They are utterly worthless and cannot be turned off. I hate them. I wish Facebook would stop adding features and just make the thing work nicely.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

I use Facebook everyday on my iPod. And I can use it for like 10 minutes then the app stops working and I have to delete the app and get it back . It has happened ever since I got the Facebook app.! And I don't like it !	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I post something it takes me back to the beginning of the news feed. Also if I want most recent, can it stay on most recent? I'm sick of having to read half of updates through most recent & then comb through news feed to find the rest. Put it back to the way it was an up date or 2 back	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Awsomee	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This is way better then having it on blackberry !!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

When I thought things were getting better, I was wrong. Awful update. Slow, lags when scrolling, crashes, pictures rarely load. I could go on. You need to seriously hire developers that know how to do their jobs. This is getting ridiculous.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Couple of diferent stuff	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Sweet, convenient love fb	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
So annoying.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Super slow updating all the time, crashes and doesn't post things half the time...	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Constantly crashing, you have to close and reopen multiple times to get things to load....come on, surely you can do better!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Every time I open it, it will crash at some point during use. Also frustrating that you can't view chat on iPad unless rotated horizontally which is not the case on iPhone.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
I like having this app on my phone, bc I can keep my place in Facebook, while I use my other browser to check around for info online before I post. I haven't really been having trouble with this app at all.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Occasionally the app doesnt record my postings and I'll have to go back and do it again. Other than that, no issues.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
This app is horrible! It constantly crashes, it's slow to open, and won't allow me to look at pictures without crashing. Fix it right ASAP!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everything is good, but you can't stay offline in messenger so I don't use it. In-app chat can be done staying offline but the keypad can be used well if it can be rotated. So make the changes.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Facebook is really boring now and I feel like Facebook in general needs something more than just a blank blue and white profile, like and comment statuses, and better security in general. The colors are dull and very boring. It should be customizable. Also, a big issue is that it's turned into a part time porn site. Very inappropriate.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app solved a lot of my problems when I accessed Facebook from my iPad.  Before only rarely could I watch a video that someone posted.  Also,  I used to do a continuation comment because my fat fingers used to hit return and post a comment before I was finished.  Easy peasy...problem solved!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love Facebook, but this app always takes too long to load, or it kicks me out of the app, and it freezes constantly. :/ disappointed	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Not sure why everyone is having so many problems.  The Facebook app has always worked fine for me, regardless of the version I have.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

It's good. It crashes here and there but I just think its my iPhone. Doesn't happen on my girlfriends Samsung	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
At first this app was terrific, loved it, no problems. NOW all I get is kicked off all the time. Some of my posts don't show up some photos do show up and I manage a page that logs me out of my wall and asks for a password to my managed page, which by the way are both  on FACEBOOK . I don't get it and no one will contact me back. I. Have written several messages about Facebook freezing and then crashing, and this last one with the page I manage. Not sure I would give this app 3 stars but at least in the beginning, back in 2007, it was pretty good till you started messing with things. Ever heard of don't fix it if its NOT BROKE??? Not happy but this is my vice to keep in touch with my family and all my friends. Leafl	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great way to keep informed & reuniting w/friends :)	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes every time its opened.  Deleted it and reinstalled it with no change.  Update did not help either.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Likes: - the option of sending a message saying why someone said on you timeline etc.- instant share button- the fact that you can see emojis- the set up of the whole app yet, I would like to see it look alot more like 'Instagram' with the things on the bottom instead of the top? (Just a suggestion) - it doesn't crash as much as it used to, it still does just not as much as the last versionDislikes:- bubble inbox- how long it takes to load a persons page/ comments etc.- it's starting to look like twitter with all the highlighted hash tags - newsfeed could be betterSuggestions: - you should get rid of the bubble inbox, it's annoying and gets in the way all the time and just pops open when someone sends you something- change it to a more similar layout to Instagram - have an option where you can manually view who you want in your personal newsfeedThank you for your time!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Australia
Crashes all the time. Takes forever to load and open pages	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love this version so much more.. A added bonus not sitting in front of the computer	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
You should let us to be able to edit our group info like the description and group photo on	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook updates too much!! The last update does make picture/video sharing easier. The app does still close a lot on its own. Overall it's good but needs updates to better the app problems not the actual layout of the pages.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It's always Crashing ! I have to re-open it all the time .! I would be better off using Safari to get on Facebook . Don't download this app .	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Terrible new app for FB.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

You need to fix it a bit! It's freezes a lot, stops working for a while.. Exits out of it then starts up again once you go back into it! Fix it pleaseIt does it over & over 	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
Update it so we can see hashtags on mobile!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The messaging system is really buggy and for me, is shaking more than a toddler suffering from an epileptic seizure. The text also overlaps or doesn't show up. But other parts Seam to be okay, so far...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I wish the app had more of the mobile features it also crashes a lot, but other then that its ok.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I'm just learning about computers --age 74--you change everything so fast makes learning that much harder.  When I look for something--it has gone away.  I'm not to happy with that.  I am having a good time but don't always understand what and why things change so rapidly.  Today is 6 - 20 -2013--I still feel the same.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
We need some changes1/ most recent needs to come at the top of page!! I hate getting and old post above one I've already comments on. 2/ we still don't have a DISLIKE or thumbs down button!3/ some posts we would like to copy not can't. Please change this.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
App update is terrible. At first, it crashed frequently. Now it doesn't load newsfeed or timeline at all. Tried reinstalling several times.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am really enjoying the app. Now that it has been made easier to copy and paste. It would be good to be able to copy and paste status comments for translation purposes. Is it possible to have happy icons etc in comments?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia

I am unable to rate the actual app because it won't load.  It's just stuck in loading mode for two days.  The good news is this nonfunctioning status sounds much better than the update itself.  Happy happy joy joy.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I really wish I could see all posts. Every time!! without having to command it to most recent posts, every time I open the app. Super frustrating.  Also, I don't think it's everyone's business every time I like a post.  No one cares to see that in their feed.  Fix those two things and we're golden.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can't open links. Says there are notifications when there aren't.  Crashes.  Terrible.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is slow and it freezes it closes all the time I'm not impressed at all.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook now won't load. I hate all the new updates. I have to go through safari to get my Facebook to load. Not cool!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Facebook is crack. The app is crap. Can't set most recent? Can't share without it popping me up to the top? Can't extend time gap zig zag. I don't like Twitter, but they've got it all over you in the app department.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Learning to enjoy it. I m a senior, so it took a while.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Time to focus on service not options.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
It is what it is	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Useful, of course, but it lags so much, freezes, shuts down, and I've had to reinstall twice recently. Using the browser is faster.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
Honestly, I thought the update would improve things but no. Just added more annoyance to the mix. I'm sick of it being SO slow to load and I'm sorry but does most recent not mean anything to you folk?! Jeez! I used to love fb app and barely used the laptop but you're really taking the mickey these days! Photo sharing is cr@p and most days the app crashes when I open it or, if I'm lucky enough that it doesn't, it will when I try to click on a photo! Sort it out please fb. This is beyond a joke.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Very nice	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

I have Facebook on my IPhone, IPad, and PC and I get different feeds from each device. Can't see a pattern but they're all different.

Just amazing it could be better but other than that amazing app it just is plain awesomeee	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Do not download this app. Use Safari and do not support the moribund programmers behind this dreck. Apple is supposedly at the forefront of technological accessibility. Yet their Facebook app, surely one of the most used by iPhone owners worldwide, is trash. It crashes constantly and frequently fails to load when refreshed. There is no reason whatsoever for this app to be so atrocious. If I could sum up my impression of Facebook for iPhone in one word, it would be "pathetic;" given two words, "REALLY pathetic."Update: The "face bubbles" in place of message notifications are preposterous--and it now crashes at least three times daily. This app is so shameful I've considered deleting my Facebook profile altogether. Not the app, my profile. You are failing at success, programmers.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very slow and annoying , please updating this version , thank you ....	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Epic Fail!!! Update makes FB unusable loads constantly... Freezes news feed....FIX IT!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
So far it works fine. However uploading a photo takes longer than before.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
It is actually works when I had my Galaxy S Vibrant the updates were terrible.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Facebook should totally have a thumbs down button !!!!! I am begging for it that would be the best thing ever!!!!!!!! 	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Always crashes. Open a link, it crashes, open the app it crashes. If I could give it a zero star rating, I would.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Crashes daily, updating and loading pages takes forever!!!!! Please fix soon!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Honestly the app is still crashing and now everytime i go in the app i have to keep hitting most recent! Its erkin	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The App is ok but wish it could mirror the desktop look and feel as well as settings	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Since the update the app often crashes and doesn't load any more than a few statuses and I can't see videos that friends have posted	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Since the updates, I have been dealing with a lot of opening then re-opening and it seems as though others have too. Hopefully this issue will get fixed. Or maybe it's the iPhones whose to really say	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Great App.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I love facebook	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

you need to fix when I want to see my pictures the application crashed and go out	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love the ease of the app, but hate that it crashes, does not show all posts that my friends, and those that I am following, post, and seems to start over on its own.  Also, with latest update, when I share an item, it does not take me back to where I was, but it takes me back to the beginning and changes from Most Recent to News Feed.  Very frustrating!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Desperately needs to be updated for speed. It gets annoying really fast when nothing loads up even on a wifi connection.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Slow slow slow slow!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sharing should be optional or not allowed to share for 3rd party if I choose that. I wish my friends and family could see us but I don't want them to share with someone else. The rest is ok.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I love it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Now thats what im talkin' it is easy to use the facebook app now more shortcuts and i can upload pics now more fast!! May I suggest try to give a function that you can move photos from album to album and album folder so you can put your personal albums like example:Party albums- xmas party album- new year eve album- my birthday party albumSelf photo album- wearing cosplay- graduation pics- wearing tuxLike that can you do that so we can manage personal album its just like puting same albums in 1 shelfGood day facebook admins	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

It would be better if I could watch videos & play games without Adobe (I have apple products)....I do like the ease of adding pictures, now.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Can't even open up messages	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I am finding the app keeps getting worse. The big update a while back was a major improvement and I thought that was a starting point for it to keep getting better. Instead it keeps getting worse.One example is comments which do not appear even after I get a notification that there is a new comment. I use to be able to refresh comments, but now that is not an option.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I love this app, Facebook was already an obsession for me but this mad it worse. It's fast,easy to update information and share pictures I Love it ‰_	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
I have to constantly reinstalled the app and once I log on, the news feed wont show up. It takes forever and I'm not pleased at all.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love all the new picture tones and update icons added. Makes it more convenient to post fast updates and pictures.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This latest version is ridiculous! Continually grinding away 'updating' without ever doing so, that I have to delete the app on my iPad and reload it just to get it to work. Unbelievable.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The messaging takes FOREVER to update. It won't let me see messages in a group chat even after refreshing the app!!!! It constantly crashes and the iPad layout is very very bad. You need to fix it Facebook!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Anytime I try to switch from page to page, view pictures, or update my news feed it either takes about twenty seconds to do so or it freezes up and suddenly jumps to somewhere I didn't want it to go.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Seriously how has no one said anything about the photos yet? You click a photo and it freezes as it loads and the app locks up. If it doesn't do that, the picture is zoomed in but when you zoom out so you can actually see the whole thing, it just zooms straight back in again. Eventually after a few goes, it stays zoomed out but the damn menu that goes away by tapping the photo so you see it without any disruptions doesn't go away without zooming in the photo again. So many pictures that are big in resolution are not viewable properly it's happened for ages, like over a Year. Don't the developers get over this stupid problem?? Instead of introducing stupid, useless features, fix the basics first and THEN add whatever you want. OMG people!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
This still does not have a share option and has many of the same glitches.  Also does not have birthdate notifications.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	New Zealand

Terrible	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The last update for the the app made the layout  for the iPod 5 look good, the launch of the app is still to slow, it launches and it's a blue bar at the top and with a with bottom, still too many buttons, like when we want to view our own profile pic or cover photo, or when we want to logout, no landscape view, and that new picture with a status update would be awesome if you would add it to sharing, and now it seem like I can't get on my account like it took 4 tries to sign into the account and it only shows the loading spinning circle, and I quit out, the multitask close the app and then open it again and it still won't load a thing, and you guys also removed the option to like a page and turn of the ability for us to still like the page, also I have liked a page and I want to go to that page and the app won't let me go to the page because the page "can't be found" but I am still getting news feed from them and that means that page is still active, and I log out of Facebook and it sill keeps me logged in, bring back posting polls from website and bring it to the app	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app works better than it does on my computer!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
What's happening???It keeps crashing every time I want to access my profile...	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The Fact That I Can't Up Load Videos Or Change My Cover Photo... Also I Dont Like That I HAVE To Crop The Picture That I Want For My Profile Picture..... Also I really dislike the news feed. I like my new feed to be left on "most recent" not top story or whatever. Thanks 	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

This update is horrible. Timeline posts blend together, the app lags and hangs. And please lose the black notification banner at the top of the app. I don't need 2 notifications for 1 post, the red flag is enough.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Most bugs seem fixed, aside that random app shutdown (way less frequent then before), way faster.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Canada

Whenever I try and view my messages or a certain page, it always closes down.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
The app should show all my friends by most recent posts by default. I should not have to go select most recent every time and then still not see all my friends activity. Facebook=Fail	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I have had a Facebook account for a while now and never really wrote anything in the comments very often but I started writing a nightly blurp a week ago and some of my fellow facebookers look forward to it and have compared it to a blog. I now really enjoy this social media thingy and look forward to my nightly writing,For that u give you a perfect 10 facebook.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Canada
Closes a lot on its own and crashes. Still constantly changes the order of my news feed. Seems to be worse with each update. Wish it would rotate to a landscape like my other phone features do. Not the best page management features either. Really wish I had more control over that while on the go.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I really enjoy fb because we can talkToFamily and friends its the only to keep updated in everything some times it freezes up on me but its ok	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

this app closes itself all the time and it's very slow. some things just don't load at all! so annoying... Seems like no one is taking the initiative to listen to these bad reviews and fix the problems. 	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I don't know why the developers FAIL at this App. It moves slow, the pictures load slow, and I can't even view new stories. Needs to be UPDATED, and the we Facebook users want it to be.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I don't like the way that it posts your post long after they happen and it even freezes up. I hate the way that Facebook has gone and feel you should go back to the old way where there weren't so many problems and people could use it easier. I hate looking in and getting a white screen with blue across the top and nothing else. It's just getting worse to even have the app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
First, I can appreciate that programming for different platforms, such as the web versus mobile, can be daunting. However, over the history of the Facebook app I have found many inconsistencies in terms of incomplete features available on the web versus the mobile versions. Also, recently there appeared to be some type of dynamic updates going on behind-the-scenes that were causing multiple crashes.  I sometimes get the sense that the team that develops for the web does not work with the team that develops for mobile.It is my hopes that Facebook will take the mobile app to higher, more consistent and stable grounds.   I also highly encourage Facebook Inc. to consider a beta program. This is standard development practice.  They can enlist the help of hundreds of thousands of users to test features  and provide feedback on usability prior to releasing them into production.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

I would prefer it if they stopped tinkering, they think it's going to make Facebook better, but that rarely happens! Security and privacy still wary about, and it seems that they adopt other social networks ideas. Here's a tip, what works for others, won't necessarily work here!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia

I find myself using the app more hen the site.  However, it crashes every now and then.  They need to work on that.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Crashes, too many updates, message bubble is annoying. It's hard to read a post because if something new shows up in the feed or you "like" a post or comment the feed scrolls back to the top. Now there's this annoying thing that opens up to add a picture even if you just want to post a simple comment in your status. I think I'm just going to use the web version. This is a royal pain. :-/	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Sorry guys but someone failed on this new FB app.  Please bring back the old version.  Sometimes simple is better.  The more you mess with it the worse it seems to get.  You use to be able to start a message and leave it for a minute to do something else but now when you go back your half written message is gone and you have to begin all over again.  Getting too much garbage in newsfeed that I didn't request or "like".  What on earth is Candy Crush!  Don't want it, need it or want to see it!  Newsfeed isn't updating any longer unless you log out and log in again. Can't search for new friends any more.  Use to love FB but check your recent ratings guys, everyone's complaining sorry to say.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada

All these new features make browsing FB way harder than before. For one thing I can't exit out of the app to view my sms because the app starts over from the beginning of the newsfeed when I go back to it?!

Ever since the update, it freezes or lags when I try to see images. Also, when I go to neck my notifications, it doesn't load properly. For example, my friend invited me to an event page and it won't load.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Horrible. Each update makes it worse. I will be in the middle of something and it kicks me out of facebook all together and I have to log in all over again.  Navigation stinks. It won't let you re-post or share posts the way I want or to someone else's wall like it does on the pc version.  Sending photos or posts in a private message is difficult pr not even a possible option. You are unable to customize who can see your posts.  You are unable to exclude a certain person from seeing your post. New posts are mixed in with older posts so you have to go thru posts you have already read to view the new stuff. It doesn't allow you to sort your news feed according to either most recent or by posts based on interests like the pc facebook does.  I only use the phone app when I don't have access to a pc now because I hate the new app changes and the user unfriendliness it is becoming	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Facebook is Facebook. I've had it for years. But now a days there are wayyyy too many crashes. It'll just log out and shut the whole app down. I will never leave Facebook sadly.

This FB is more responsive, but it also is more restrictive in what you can say politically. The truth hurts sometimes, but you need to be able to tell it. On the other hand I would like to see vulgar language flagged. When it updates or refreshes you have to wait for the action to finish what you are doing. It is a good way for people to exchange ideas and keep the democratic process alive. This version updates a lot and holds up the actions like share or comment.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Please stop updating Facebook. PLEASE. If you guys truly go through with the hashtag idea, I think I will be deleting my account. You're losing your originality...you're losing the essence you began with, the essence of social media by blending with other social media outlets desperately trying to match their developments. A year ago I would have given you 5 stars. 6 months ago, 4, today I give you 2 based on exasperation from the constant alterations and in dread of your promise to rival twitter with hashtags. Don't do it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
This app was awesome but NOW its JUST so SLOW...AND CRASHES	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Most recent news feed doesn't work right. Overall the app is just poorly put together. Rarely works well.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It's a good way to keep in touch with friends and family.... I just wish I could play my Facebook games like FarmVille and dragon city without downloading a whole other app!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Its facebook what can you say	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	Australia

Takes three plus tries to open the app. Constantly switches from most recent to top stories whenever it wants. Also if you login for example at 4pm then dont login until 11pm that night all the stories that happened from 4pm-11pm wont show up unless at all. Im just deleting this crap and sticking to PC.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very good but still will like to be able to delete comments once posted.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
Buggy and news feed is stupid. Bring back most recent... Not this top story BS.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I use interest lists to keep up with my Facebook feed, but this latest redesign makes it almost impossible to use them.I can choose the list and start scrolling and reading no problem. But heaven forbid I need to put down my phone for a second or want to re-share something I find. Unlike the previous version, this one flips you back to the top of the feed instead of saving where you were last when you return to the feed. Very frustrating.At least they seemed to have fixed to constant crashing with this update, that's what the single star is for.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes too much	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Great app, but kinda spotty and inconsistent.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Can't look at comments. Slow to refresh, if at all. Have to use browser for anything to work.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I can't fully load up my fb and it takes forever to load pics and comments and it closes on me :/ please fix this because I'm not satisfied with the update at all!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
What the heck is wrong with this app?! Can't even access my page. Posts duplicate on newsfeed. Can't open friends' photos. Can't comment on friends' posts. Bad, bad update.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
La aplicaciÌ_n se cierra por abrir el chat, o abrir una imagen, muy mala aplicaciÌ_n, mejor usen Safari para checar Facebook	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Could do so much better. Very slow and disorganized. I'd rather not use Facebook than use this app most of the time	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	Canada
The app is very good; sometimes it does crash or takes several times to open but other then that its really good!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Does not open. Slows my whole system down. How can you call that update? It's a failed app now.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
I've never had more troubles with an app crashing in my life!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

You will get more stars when the app stops force closing. Other wise it's fine.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
I found the now 'faster' app crashes and lags a lot more than the previous version, which you said would be resolved. The previous version was better only because it never slowed down enough to completely freeze my iPad. - fix that	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	New Zealand

Wish I could rate it zero stars.Open app and it crashes so I have to open it again...happens EVERY TIME I open it. Wish I could make a  with an unhappy face. Mark Zuckerberg needs to hire a 12 year old kid to rebuild this app from scratch. Whoever is doing it now spends all their time making it pretty instead of making it work correctly and stable. My 2 å¢	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It keeps crashing, my comments disappear and I have to restart the app to get my notifications. This never used to happen up until the last few updates. I am not alone with these problems. It happens on both iPhone and iPad !!!!even after updating its still happening.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

I love Facebook and this app has ruined it, when I'm listening to music and I click on a video to watch it on Facebook, the music obviously goes off, but when I want to listen to the music again it won't let me because the video hasn't stopped, also on the old update when you wanted to stop watching the video you could just scroll up or down away from the video, but it still plays, sort it out mate.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
This app loads SO slowly. I hardly check my FB on my iPhone anymore because the wait is not worth it.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Dumb update, it will sometimes crash when I try typing a message or sending a picture with my messages, sometimes lags when I comment in a post with a photo, but overall it's a pretty good app, just fix the crashes and the lagging.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

For the most part the app has improved a great amount, but I find myself having to reopen FB after crashing several times a day. as a person who used FB a lot, this has brought me plenty of aggravation. I've been in several positions where I would write a long message, look through news feed, or scroll through pictures, and the app would just close on me. aggravating right?! Please fix bugs.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
The new update is not user friendly and is super confusing. Facebook needs to stop "fixing" things that aren't broken before they become they land themselves in the social media grave yard like MySpace	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not loading news feed at all. Just freezes on one screen!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

The App shuts down for no apparent reason several times during use. I also get warnings I've got notifications and yet when I go on I have none. The App loads up the content in a disorganised manner so the timeline is not fluid. I do like the new message 'pop up head' design though!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
This app is very unreliable.quite a few times on my iPhone it won't load a page or its still got stuff from the previous day or it just won't let me post and when I make a comment on the post it repeatedly disappears or if I can post it comes up 2 or 3 times	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I see some changes could be made to the set up of the display pages and sides where we look for friends does not work the friends list for me is not complete. When I search for friends like alastair sargent who is my son in law there was no match I dont get it.Need to improve. But thanks for facebook.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

This current version of the app is so slow! If you try and refresh the news feed to actually view 'most recent' stories the app just stalls and hangs and leaves you viewing the same stories you've seen the last 10 times you've opened the app! Also photos + their comments are always 'loading' but never actually 'load'...very annoying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
At the end of its life I say, I closing mine down due to privacy and the YANKS spying and fb being so weak to say NO	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK

Does Facebook have a new format on iPhones? my friend just updated his fb app earlier and his fb format looks diff than mine (his format looks new). Is this a bug or something?	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Everyone who hates it. Forget you it's amazing. I haven't had a problem with it crashing one bit (Maybe u all hate it because u have the iPhone 3GS) the hardware on the old iPhones can't handle the software the new Facebook has so maybe u people need to buy new phones! (I'd prefer the 4S or the 5) so u guys shush up and get new phones. Now I will admit it can crash sometimes but I honestly don't have a problem with it. All they need to do is in the next update, they need to allow the messaging bubbles outside the app and into the Home Screen and all the other 800,000 apps out there. So I won't have to leave the app I'm currently on and go to Facebook just to reply to my friend I'm messaging.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

This most recent update is much cleaner and more user-friendly than it was in the past, but STILL NO LANDSCAPE VIEW AVAILABLE (except in photos). WHY? Is it beyond the developers' capabilities? So many people have asked for this simple feature, but you ignore the requests and then expect good ratings?(21-06-2013)*****Seriously? Another update and you still won't bring back landscape view despite countless people's requests? You used to have it, so it's possible. Maybe it's time to hire some new developers.(06-11-2012)*****So many people asked to have the landscape view brought back. Another update and still this isn't fixed. Why not? It's time consuming and frustrating to use, now. Disappointed.(22-09-2012)*****This is actually a REALLY good update - the best yet - but there's one thing missing: there's no longer a landscape view available. I have always turned my iPhone sideways as it makes it a lot easier to type this way, but this option is no more, and I now have a cramp in my arm as a result. If you can bring the landscape option back, I'll give you five stars. :)By the way, it's SO much better without the photo tags showing up all the time, and the updates are excellent!

If I could rate it 0 stars, I would!! Horrible!! It takes forever to load a page (I'm standing 2ft from my modem with wifi) "most recent" doesn't work, loads things from 2-3 days ago.. Constantly crashes, slow to use and NEVER LOADS A PAGE!! Pathetic!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

I remember when Facebook just came  out. I mean everybody at the time was using MySpace. We all left their and went to Facebook, and it was great to begin with. But yeah.... Everything has changed, We started following twitters example with hashtag, Facebook only had one original idea and it was Facebook. Don't get me wrong I love Facebook it's a good way to stay connected but still. I will say this and then I'll shut up, I really like how now you can do feelings. And if your notifications keep popping up just go to your settings and turn it off to where doesn't show how many notifications you have. It gets less annoying	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
We complain and complain, and you listen!  Thanks guys. This last update works better than great. Did you guys just set out expectations low in purpose?  Seriously, great job!No problems with login, newsfeed update, picture viewing, or commenting. Happy!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA

It's ok, sometimes it's crashes but its ok. And also, you should do option in messages others, coz I can check them on laptop, but I can't see them on iPhone5	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
When loading the news feed it doesn't give the status' in order. At the top will be from yesterday and as I scroll down il have ones from 5 minutes ago. Very annoying. Very slow when loading. When loading the application open it just closes for no reason then doesn't let me reopen for the next 2/3 attempts. Awful	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
WHY did you remove the availability to share from your feed to a group? grrrrr The app is easy to use but you keep changing things and taking useful things away. STOP IT! Being able to play all the games on mobile that one plays on the full site would be nice. Because you took away something I liked, I took away a star.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Drives me mad but I love the app :)	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
Your updates are crap. You constantly add and change things but never actually FIX anything. I wish I could give you NO STARS!This app crashes and force closes randomly. Sometimes immediately, sometimes after having it open for 5 minutes. You seriously need to figure out what's wrong first, then add and play with whatever else you feel like doing.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
FINALLY, an update that doesn't crash! Thanks for finally writing an app that works well with the iPod Touch 4g. I only had to wait for about 7 updates to get from one stable version to another stable one.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
There seems to be an ever increasing problem in this app of keeping things in chronological order. I've got posts from several days past appearing at the top of my posts.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada
Pretty functional.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Canada

This App Facebook is nice I already have Facebook Since I'm 6 or 7 years old Facebook is my Hobbie but now I'm already 9. But Facebook when you go update your app again Next Time can you please add The Delete This Album Because I'm deleting albums I'll still need to go in Safari Not just in Facebook and I wish I can make Fan page Too here in fb Thanx.! :)                    Love,Desiree :D	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
I can't get it to refresh the feed since the update i have to uninstall and then reinstall!  I have just been using the browser for Facebook.  Hope there is a fix soon because this is a pain!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Hate that you can't see "recent post by others" on groups!!!! HATE!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Since the last app update, FB won't update content on my iPad. It opens, says its updating, and just keeps thinking whilst it is 'updating'. And nothing updates. I have no new news/posts after Wednesday 19th June.  It works fine on the home PC though. VERY annoyed!First time I've ever left a review also and finding this hard to do due to requirement of a nickname, and finding one that has not been used by someone else!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
The only thing that needs to be changed/added etc is being able to delete a comment	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
I Love The New Facebook , especially how you can say how you feellibg . But it would be better if we could of change it to w.e color we want .	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It's all pretty good until it comes to checking in. It's taken away the option of not having GPS on, and you also can't add places just for fun	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Can't post from my iPhone to page a manage anymore. :( How can I go back to the last version??!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
When loading the app, it's extremely laggy and just shows it loading, I updated it after the App Store notified me to update Facebook, I updated it now the app doesn't even work compared to what it did before the update was released, it's a fix that need doing and fast	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
For what it's worth it's a great app. Only negative is that occasionally when I open it and its loading it'll just shut down so I have to reopen. Other than that no problem does the job fine	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
It's really too bad I like using Facebook but the updates don't seem to work and it knocks out my whole phone. Also now all of a sudden people I don't even know can add me as a friend without my approval so I have to block them.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I like it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	Australia
Before i did the update i was perfectly fine, now when updating a status facebook keeps telling me to learn more from my update, its annoying me now!!! Also, my pictures are missing round the edges! Sort it out, feel to just use the crappy internet fb!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

Good for apple I suppose. But mine tends to just randomly go off when I'm In the middle of Inboxing someone or commenting on a status, also all the buttons on it are getting to be ridiculous should go back to straight forward simple facebook no buttons no stickers just simple facebook..	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
good	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
Can't even download the updated app so now I can't even get on Facebook real good guys what is the problem!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Crashed when opening the MSG chat box.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The worst update yet. When commenting on my own posts or others posts the comment disappears right before my eyes when I press post button. Ridiculous. Also what was so wrong with having a friends list that was in alphabetical order. Why should I have to do a search for my own friends in my own friends list. When a photo is tapped for full view it's really glitchy & not a smooth change. Quite annoying actually. App randomly crashes on iphone 4s with latest software update.These are my main issues with app that I can remember at the moment. You've really lost the plot this time. 0 stars is way too high. Negative 10 stars at best.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
The latest version has a bug where I can't see comments in posts anymore.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	Australia
This is getting old. Update after update and you still fail to fix the crash issue. Geez.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia
I love it	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	5	UK
The app has improved. I like the share post function. However it leaves out some of the best features like the edit post function.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Amazing. I use Facebook everyday but it would be nice if we were able to see what our friends post, and what the pages post, on like some sort of different timeline. Or have a tab for friends posts and one for the pages that we like. I miss what my actual friends post because the pages post too much. That is my only issue and besides the games, that is it.Love, this frequent and forever user.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
Well sometimes the photos do load slow although I have the fastest wifi cox offers, and LTE when not at home. Plus I have crashing issues at least 3-4 times a week. Otherwise it's ok. iPhone 5	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Hate how it bounces around . Updates usually mean trouble but I always hope for the best that the issues will be resolved... Silly me the updates just have different issues !! There have been a few versions in the last 100 updates that actually worked properly . Any reason there are always stupid changes that don't even work ? Try fixing the issues and not try to make it different .	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
It almost always crashes wen I first try to get on n sum times takes pics 4ever to post.  Other than that it alright.  No biggie!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Would be nice if this app didn't crash so much. Plus when you post that your post don't disappear and post correctly. Other than that, it's a pretty good app.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

It's incredibly slow with the new update, it used to be rapid. Doesn't upload the newsfeed anymore. It cuts off the picture edge whenever I load a photo. Was this even tested before release? Don't update!!!!!!!!!!!!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK

I do not like that I cannot set my default view on my iPhone to Most Recent. You guys need to consider fixing that.  Also, I have noticed that when I share something, my most recent timeline removes a large portion of things that were just there. I have to be sure to go all the way back to the last time I looked at Facebook or I miss the chance to see many updates (about 12 hours worth of info disappears).	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I'm sure we will all get used to the bottom navigation bar, but this constant crashing of the app is unacceptable. Also, when I am scrolling through my feed, it will randomly just back to the top. Sometimes I've scrolled through DAYS of posts, and when it jumps tithe top 1) I lose my place and 2) my phone has to reload all pics/vids and links! What's more is, Facebook seems to be taking extra long to load pictures and other content.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I can't even open Facebook without it crashing sometimes up to 5 times, I am having problems with messages loading and it's down right attrocious!! I'm so sick of you not getting it right and each update being worse than the last! For such a common app one would expect far better!	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

Easier to change the privacy settings on a post.Harder, if not impossible, to share things on a page you manage or on a friends's wall.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
For the most part I like the Facebook app. The one thing I would add, however, is to option to search for things within a group page. I run into the issue of wanting to find something on a page and not be able to find it very easily due to not having that available to me.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
The pictures are great and it's apt faster, the only thing I have a problem with is the print somehow on the latest version is so much smaller and because I have glaucoma it is very hard fore to read the post ! This is the only way I can keep in touch with my Son who is in Afghanistan he is USA Navy and my second son David is in Japan ( Air Force) and my third son is on the other side of the United States from me he is a Minister in the Church ! My Sons travel all over and this is my form of communication with them , I'm 70 yrs old and have a great need to stay in touch with Momma's Boys !

I like being connected socially and this app fills that need. I don't find a lot of bugs with it despite how many times I'm prompted to update the app. Then again I'm not doing a lot of posting or sharing just a lot of Facebook creeping.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA

Every time I open Facebook it either closes or doesn't load. When im writing someone it close down and delete the messages. It's always closing on. I'm having to reopen it. A lot. It makes me not even wanna use this app. This needs to be fixed and fast .	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Love that y'all did the emotions now with the iPhone app. Just need to get the event page more up to date like the Mobile app. You can't edit it from the iPhone app. I still have to go to the desk top or mobile app to do a lot of things	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA

Since the last Facebook "upgrade", I find it impossible to navigate pages or receive updates in a timely matter.  Add to that the constant crashing, I'd give this the worst review I have ever written.	1371798000	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I don't know what's going on with the new updates to Facebook mobile devices (iPad & iPhone), but I think they are the pits. Response time is slower than before. Is there a way I can go back to the previous version? We can no longer delete messages from mobile devices? I actually liked that feature.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Keeps crashing when I'm chatting, sometimes it crash while checking notifications... Please fix! It used to work perfectly for iPhone 5	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Previous update took away landscape mode, this one screws up timeline order. I just access thru safari.  Lol guess I'll just add on to my previous review.

I sure wish this lousy app would stop crashing every time I try to open it. I'm better off using safari.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
getting better and better.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK
This app is total garbage and has been since cover photos started.  Get it together Zuckerberg!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
This app is brilliant but the updates seem pointless as they don't solve the biggest problem which is if you scroll too fast down your newsfeed or even click on a Facebook profile that it has difficulty in loading it will just cut you off, which is annoying when your half way through reading or commenting and it puts you back to your newsfeed :(	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	UK
Great app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
This app is great now! Now they jus need to fix the messenger app -_-	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
It doesn't sort the likers by time as before!!! 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes constantly after updateEDIT: crash was fixed long ago, but most recent update is a design horror. Stay away!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The process of searching a new friend and a new page is too slow!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Doesn't let me see comments and crashes every other time I open it. The updates keep making it worse. I have resorted to just using safari.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Crashes constantly when messaging on my 4s. Hangs periodically. Takes way too long to load from the lock screen.The new update doesn't fix any of the above bugs, but adds the "feature" that messages sometimes won't open at all.Aren't you supposed to know how to do this app development thing, Facebook?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I think the app is pretty good.  It occasionally forces itself closed, but it starts right back up.  It's easy to log-in and out if needed.  I like that I can open links right in the app without my Internet pages opening, but I do wish it was more clear on which arrows control the navigation of the link and which take me back to Facebook.  Otherwise, it works great for me!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
New update sinks!!!!!! I can't update my "most recent" newsfeed at all, (its constantly trying to update, but to no avail) can't see any new notifications, I can't see my own posts or page!! Even uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times, updates once then no more "new" stories...until I shut off my phone or uninstall and reinstall!!!!:( fix this ASAP!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Very Good :))	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	5	USA
How are you going to market an app for such a huge audience and have it not even work? Constantly crashes, never loads new stories, freezes 9 times out of 10 when I push any button or swipe. This is on a brand new phone that every other app works brilliantly on. I could write a better app when I'm drunk. Delete	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
The last 2 updates just made it worst. It crashes every 5 mins or so. When u share omething it takes u back to the top of the page. Its really annoying. Gotta fix this app.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Have tried about fifteen times to update this app but it keeps telling me there's an error message. No matter what I do to try to make it work, now I can't use this at all. Stop the constant updates and give us something consistent that's going to last a while. Also, get rid of the bubbles when someone sends us a message. The simple numbers at the top of the screen were all we needed.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
I find that using the mobile version is very limited. It seems to crash or freeze quite a bit too. Still love it. Keep improving please.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Don't understand the really negative reviews, this app works beautifully for me and I've never had many problems with it. The only thing that holds back the extra star is that the security features on the app still don't fully match the browser version, which is a bit annoying. But otherwise, it's great!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	UK

The last updates make it extremely hard to view your newsfeed. As soon as you share something, it automatically scrolls up to the top. Meaning, you have to start over again, and again, and again. Absolutely assinine!Between the above and the frequent crashes, it's very difficult to use.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Latest update brought things to a screeching halt. News feed and status updates moving at a snails pace. I can walk to my office and log into my computer faster than navigating the app. Please fix this!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
I always get blocked by Facebook when I send out requests to people I know or people are related to me by marriage. Wished this would stop. If I didn't know the person then I wouldn't send any requests.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Don't try to force me to add a picture to my status update.  That's why there are two separate options.  SMH..  Scrolling is painfully slow.  And no option to edit a comment or status, just delete it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

Ok. It's nicer to open FB app than to log in all the time in Safari. Why did the "Share to Group or Page" option suddenly disappear?! Normally I'd give leeway to an app, but FB is now FULLY integrated into the iPhone itself. Keep up. Seriously.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
The app keeps crashing just about over it already.Fix bugs or I'm uninstalling what sense does it make to have it if cant use it.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
So every time Facebook is open and I get a mail or notification it freezes then fully shuts down the app and takes a few moments to load again. Constantly freezes and crashed upon trying to launch app. When the app is closed it'll tell me I have a random number of notifications (for example it'll say I have 20 notifications when I have 2mails.) chat freezes. Videos never upload upon first try, if they do upload at all that is.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	UK
Used the new update for 4 minutes; the app crashes once and I am no longer able to see when people have replied to comments on pages I follow.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada

FB used to be so fun and fast to work with. Now with all the new updates lately it is so so slow. People now have so much fun to block you from seeing or commenting when ever they desire to, and that took all enjoyment out of FB for me and others I know. I get knocked off and have to restart and sometimes have to even sign in again. It even drains my battery just waiting to open a notification or any other pages of my FB sites. It doesn't get much better, just gets worse where now I don't even like much of evening looking at FB anymore. All the fun has gone out of it. I keep having to delete my app and download again just to pick up some speed on it, then within 10 minutes its so slow again.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Never know what will appear on newsfeed. There is no consistency with what appears. Posts change every time I open, keeping in the same sort mode.

Update: Seriously, why wont the news feed stay in the mode I choose until I decide to change it? EVERY time I go back to the app I have to choose "most recent." Although even that isn't working well; "most recent" currently has a handful of posts from the past 20 minutes and then jumps to five hours ago. "News feed" just jumps all around in time. Going back to Safari for now. Love the new look and the choices for news feed. But please quit reverting back to what appears to be your idea of the most important posts. If I choose "most recent," I want it to stay there until I change it. Why you would use "top stories" is beyond me; it ends up showing me the same posts I saw hours ago over and over. Should be "most recent" by default; that's the only way to be sure you're seeing everything you want to see. Especially annoying when you're trying to keep up with news posts during breaking news. There is also an annoying delay in loading the news feed choices, so when I scroll up to change to most recent, I end up clicking on something I didn't mean to and have to go back and choose it again. Wasting a lot of time with this new setup.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is so/so u can't copy the text, fascist book (facebook) censors posts, sanctions u if u friend to many people, post to too many groups whom u belong.

I hate the fact that I chose to have resent activities show when I open not some news feed. I get tired of having to change it. This app is really not that good. Take time out to listen to the people who writes you reviews, that way you will no we are unhappy.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
This app is awesome and I'm loving all the updates lately :) making the experience better and easier to check what my friends are up to. Only problem is it will randomly boot me out of my app and send me to my home screen :/ otherwise amazing	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	4	USA
It crashes a lot! It's not  just the iPhone version either it's the app in general. It won't let me open pictures all the time when it does decide to its really really really slow. I like the app it seems to be doing a little better since the last update, but I don't want to speak too soon.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

App throws you out. Long times to load photos.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Not only does this app crash continuously, but the functionality is very confusing and poorly thought out.-Notifications get "stuck" in that you sometimes have a mystery number on the icon. -Sharing web addresses in chat window is shaky at best as the sometimes don't send or show up, leading you to ask the recipient if they actually got it. -Setting up photo albums and editing them is nearly impossible.-Timeline updates are very unreliable as well, randomly hiding posts or posting out of order.-Organizing friends is also difficult, and removing someone from favorites is done automatically rather than something you can control.-Double listing for "other friends"You are better off using the browser on your mobile.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

At last! An update that is actually an improvement!!! After about six awful "updates," the app is finally somewhat functional again!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Will not open or load. The only reason at all that I still have this app is because you do not have competition. A total disappointment. Spend less time adding things that slow the app down and more time making it simple to use. I don't need to run actual Facebook I have a computer for that keep it simple stupid!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

What is extremely annoying is the app will tell me I have 12-13 notification, but when I go to it, I only have 1-2.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Every single time I go into my inbox and start writing a message, 3/4 times I get halfway through a massive paragraph message and the entire app just closes and I lose my message! Make it save the message automatically!The "sent at xx" is really annoying, every time I click the sidebar it says I have a message and I have to go through everything to find out if I actually do and it's just really frustrating to deal with "sent" "sent" every single message I need to check.The "most recent" is all I want it set to, not every single time I have to click all of them to get rid of the 20+ on "News Feed", "Top Stores" and usually "Most Recent" shows top stories, so you have to close out and re-open.The chat bubbles, worst idea yet... They constantly bug out, if you click to open them they sometimes open and close and vice-versa, the limit is 4? Why not have them loaded down the side so you can have more than that?Everything else with the app is okay, there's no editing option for photo captions, shouldn't be too hard to add right?	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

First off, I have an awesome Iphone 4 and have zero issues with it. Ihated the updates so much due to their lack of compatibility that I deleted it all together. This app crashes at the click of anything from messaging, adding photos, leaving comments to simply scrolling through the news feed. I am currently downloading it again to verify whether or not its the updates onto the old app and if it betters with a new download all together.  We shall see but I'm truly not optimistic as this app has epically failed worse and worse following each update.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I am really happy that "feelings" etc can now be added to statuses via the app. But a little disappointed at the very small amount of feelings available and the inability to create your own with an emoticon you choose.. )	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Australia

I never review apps. I find the process tedious. But for this stupid app I will make an exception. FB is a necessity but they can't seem to get something as basic as their app correct right now. It crashes constantly. It drives me nuts. It will crash mid-conversation. It will crash when uploading a photo. Forget trying to take a photo via the Facebook app. Crashes. Want to post on a friends wall? Nope. Sorry. Crash. Stupid. Fix these things before making the app fancier and more liable to crash stupid FB.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA

I use FB for news and other articles and the screen stopped the rotation feature some time back and that means I can no longer expand the text to a size my 65 year old eyes can read. As a result I turn to Twitter as their screen still rotates to landscape allowing expansion of the text.The sort feature doesn't work as it once did. It sorts itself to most popular but my interest is most recent. My daily status posts sometimes take several hours to days to appear and then they are one right after the other. Pages used to be easy to find and follow but with the changes I haven't been able to find new pages I'm interested. Fortunately, so far, new pages are also on Twitter so can read them there.Searching for individuals has also become more complex and frustrating so I've given up.I'm getting more and more ads from companies themselves or posted by friends. Typically 3 businesses will be grouped in one status update. Sometimes a friend's name will be listed as making a recommendation of the biz or product but this makes no sense as some are not in the area in which my friends and I reside.And then this thing of 'XYZ may post on your behalf' is ridiculous. I'm 100% able to post myself. Why would I want someone else do it for me?Facebook should just drop the mobile app and stick with the computer. FB has lost to Twitter.March 2013: Considering dropping FB completely.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA
Whenever I open it up it just crashes, I have to do this a few times before it finally works on my iPod however I've recently purchsed an iPad mini and it works much better but still slow and takes ages to post pictures from your library. I think it's better to use Facebook on safari	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	UK
Constant crashes since last update!! Sooo irritating! I can't view my profile without it crashing. & when I'm on my newsfeed it is constantly sending me back to the top on its own. Can't view pictures or videos. Ridiculous. 	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	USA
Dragging The Bubbles Around Has Made The App VERY Unique! I Love That I Can Now Update What I'm Doing From Mobile, And The Appearance Of The App Is Flawless! But, I Entered My Name Incorrect And Now It Won't Let Me Change It To The Correct Spelling. Fix This Ill Surely Give It Five Stars And Recommend It To Everyone!(:	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
Je deteste le nouveau facebook, ou mes icones sont en bas et que tous les choix y sont et que je ne tasse pas a droite pour avoir mes options ! JE L'AHI VRAIMENT ! REDONNEZ MOI LUI AVD LES CHOSES EN HAUT. MERCI.	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	1	Canada
Well, the last update stopped the crashing at the price of ALWAYS losing your place in the newsfeed when you come back. Want to look at that link more carefully? Do t do it if you want to stay where you're at in the newsfeed! It makes the app almost worthless.Facebook, the solution is simple: GET RID OF THE AUTOMATIC REFRESHING OF THE NEWSFEED!!!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	2	USA

Facebook is fun and cute but they keep changing things once you've gotten used to a certain way. And the privacy issues keep getting more and more compromising. And WHAT business offers NO REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE??!!	1371711600	Facebook	6.2	review	3	USA
